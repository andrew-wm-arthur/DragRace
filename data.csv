More specifically I'm using ways that don't involve using #defined constants like M_PI, or hardcoding the number in.

The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable; I've included it as a baseline to compare the other versions against. In my tests, with builtins, the `4 * atan(1)` version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the `atan(1)` into a constant. With `-fno-builtin` specified, the `atan2(0, -1)` version is fastest.

Here's the main testing program (`pitimes.c`):

        for (i = 0; i < ITERS; ++i)                                             \

        asm("fldpi" : "=t" (pi));

And a build script that builds all the configurations I'm testing (`build.sh`):

    #!/bin/sh
    gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m32 -o fldpi-32.o fldpi.c

    gcc -O3 -Wall -fno-builtin -m64 -o pitimes3-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm

Apart from testing between various compiler flags (I've compared 32-bit against 64-bit too, because the optimisations are different), I've also tried switching the order of the tests around. `The atan2(0, -1)` version still comes out top every time, though.

The way this timer works in the control of the timer is put on another thread so it can always tick along with the work begin completed on the parent thread when it is not busy.

The issue I have is that with this timer in a console application is that while the timer is ticking along on another thread the main thread is not doing anything so the app closes.

I tried adding a while true loop but then the main thread is too busy when the timer does go off.

> CAST(0x44004500...06F007200 AS
> NVARCHAR(4000))

I've tried all of the following commands with no luck:

    txtDecodedText.Text = System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlDecode(txtURLText.Text);         
    
    txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
    
    txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));         
    
    txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
    
    txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtURLText.Text));

Can anybody suggest the proper way to translate this encoding without using SQL Server. Is is possible? I'll take VB.net code since I'm familiar with that too.##C##<c#><vb.net><sql>##C##@$R$@

I've been given a database with newarly 300 tables in it and I need to turn this into a MySQL database.  My first call was to use bcp but unfortunately it doesn't produce valid CSV - strings aren't encapsulated so you can't deal with any row that has a string with a comma in it (or whatever you use as a delimiter) and I would still have to hand write all of the create table statements as obviously CSV doesn't tell you anything about the data types.

What would be better is if there was some tool that could connect to both SQL Server and MySQL and then do a copy.  You lose views, stored procedures, trigger, etc. but it isn't hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one DB to another... is it?

Does anybody know of such a tool?  I don't mind how many assumptions it makes or what simplifications occur, as long as it supports integer, float, datetime and string.  I have to do a lot of pruning, normalising, etc. anyway so I don't care about keeping keys, relationships or anything like that but I need the initial set of data in fast!##C##<csv><ansi><sql><php><mssql><mysql>##C##@$R$@

My contracts table consists of some standard contract information, with a column for the primary department. This column is a foreign key to my Departments table, where I store the basic department name, id, notes. This is all setup and functioning in my SQL Server.

When I use the XSD tool, I can drag both tables in at once and it auto detects/creates the foreign key I have between these two tables. This works great when I'm on my main page and am viewing contract data.

However, when I go to my administrative page to modify the department data. I typically do something like this:

    Dim dtDepartment As New DepartmentDataTable()
    Dim taDepartment As New DepartmentTableAdapter()
    
    taDepartment.Fill(dtDepartment)

However, at this point an exception is thrown saying to the effect that there is a foreign key reference broken here, I'm guessing since I don't have the Contract DataTable filled. 

Has anybody encountered this before? I know I can simply remove the foreign key from the XSD to make things work fine, but having the additional integrity check there and having the XSD schema match the SQL schema in the database is nice.##C##<.net><database>##C##@$R$@

Americans use 10,000.50, Germans use 10.000,50, French use 10 000,50 etc.
My first approach would be: Take the string, parse it backwards, until I encounter a separator and use this as my decimal separator. The obvious flaw with that: 10.000 would be interpreted as 10.
Another approach: if the string contains 2 different non-numeric characters, use the last one as the decimal separator and discard the others. If I only have one, check if it occurs more than once and discard it if it does. It it only appears once, check if it has 3 digits after it. If yes, discard it, otherwise use it as decimal separator.

The obvious "best solution" would be to detect the User's culture or Browser, but that does not work if you have a Frenchman an an en-US Windows/Browser.

I have one main class which acts like the public interface, with methods like play(), stop(), pause(), record()...etc. Then I have workhorse classes which do the video decoding and video encoding. 

I just learned about the existence of nested classes in C++, and I'm curious to know what programmers think about using them. I'm a little wary and not really sure what the benefits/drawbacks are, but they seem (according to the book I'm reading) to be used in cases such as mine.

The book suggests that in a scenario like mine, a good solution would be to nest the workhorse classes inside the interface class, so there are no separate files for classes the client is not meant to use, and to avoid any possible naming conflicts? I don't know about these justifications. Nested classes are a new concept to me. Just want to see what programmers think about the issue.##C##<c++><oop>##C##@$R$@

A common engire is written in C/C++ and VB6 uses these functions in order to improve performance. 

When it comes to asynchronous programming, a C interface is not enough and we rely on COM controls to fire events to VB6.

My problem is that when I say in VB6 that I want to use a registered contorl, VB load this control in memory and does not unload it until I quit the VB6 IDE. As the control is loaded the whole time, I am unable to recompile it in VC6, because the DLL file is locked.

A solution I found is not to enable the control in VB but use the CreateObject() with the full name of my control. The problem then is that I must declare my control as an Object because VB6 knows nothing of the interface I am using and I do not have access to IntelliSense, which is a pain.

Any idea how I can tell VB6 to unload controls after quitting the application ? or directly in the IDE ?

Assume you are doing something like the following

    List<string> myitems = new List<string>
    {
        "Item 1",
        "Item 2",

    ComboBox box = new ComboBox();
    box.DataSource = myitems;
 
    ComboBox box2 = new ComboBox();
    box.DataSource = myitems

So now we have 2 combo boxes bound to that array, and everything works fine. But when you change the value of one combo box, it changes BOTH combo boxes to the one you just selected.

Now, I know that Arrays are always passed by reference (learned that when i learned C :D), but why on earth would the combo boxes change together? I don't believe the combo box control is modifying the collection at all. 

As a work around, don't this would achieve the funcionality that is expected / desired

Now, there is a development and a live one. As this should be part of a buildscript (standard windows batch, even do with current complexity of those scripts, i might switch to PowerShell or so later), Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count.

Would you just copy the .mdf File and attach it? I am always a bit careful when working with binary data, as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time).

Or - given the lack of "EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).

And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data, the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead, which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change.

Now, i hear a lot of great stuff about the [Red Gate][1] products, but for hobby projects, the price is a bit steep.

So, what are you using to automatically deploy SQL Server Databases from Test to Live?

I've got Windows authentication mode set in the Web.config, disabled anonymous access and configured the correct default domain in IIS, but it's still asking the user to log in and, more annoyingly, the user is required to provide the domain too (*DOMAIN\auser*), which is causing problems with non-technical visitors.

From what I've seen the DB2 extensions and DB2 software from IBM only run under Linux. I've tried compiling the extensions with all the software from IBM and even tried their precompiled ibm_db2 extension with no luck. IBM only supports Linux so I turned on the Linux emulation in the kernel but that didn't seem to help anything.

If anyone has run across getting everything to run natively under OpenBSD that would be great, but what I think I may have to do is setting up a second server running CentOS with DB2 installed (most likely via ZendCore for IBM since it seems to do all this for me) and the driver so that I can set up a small transaction server that I can post against and get a JSON representation of the DB2 data that I need.

Now, my first idea was [SQL Server Compact edition][1]. That is really nicely integreated, but it can not run off a network.

[Firebird][2] seems to have the same issue, but the .net Integration seems to be not really first-class and is largely undocumented.

[Blackfish SQL][3] looks interesting, but there is no trial of the .net Version. Pricing is also OK.

I am concerned that if two users start editing the same record then the last to commit the update would be the 'winner' and important information may be lost. A number of solutions come to mind but I'm not sure if I am going to create a bigger headache.

 1. Do nothing and hope that two users are never going to be editing the same record at the same time. *- Might never happed but what if it does?*
 2. Editing routine could store a copy of the original data as well as the updates and then compare when the user has finished editing. If they differ show user and comfirm update *- Would require two copies of data to be stored.*
 3. Add last updated DATETIME column and check it matches when we update, if not then show differences. *- requires new column in each of the relevant tables.*
 4. Create an editing table that registers when users start editing a record that will be checked and prevent other users from editing same record. *- would require carful thought of program flow to prevent deadlocks and records becoming locked if a user crashes out of the program.*

The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify 

The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).

The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.

Now here's the rub:  
When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an alloc; when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, VS2008/MSVC9 or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above 50%, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming 1.3G of 2G of RAM).  So, **I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.**
  
My current best guesses as to where to next is:

1. Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an E6550 Core2 Duo); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or
2. Rewrite operators new and delete to use VirtualAlloc and VirtualProtect to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under MSVC6 and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites new and delete?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.

And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.

A collegue just walked past and asked "Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?"

When data is stored on disk based storage devices, it is stored as blocks of data. These blocks are accessed in their entirety, making them the atomic disk access operation. Disk blocks are structured in much the same way as linked lists; both contain a section for data, a pointer to the location of the next node (or block), and both need not be stored contiguously.

Due to the fact that a number of records can only be sorted on one field, we can state that searching on a field that isn’t sorted requires a Linear Search which requires N/2 block accesses, where N is the number of blocks that the table spans. If that field is a non-key field (i.e. doesn’t contain unique entries) then the entire table space must be searched at N block accesses.

Whereas with a sorted field, a Binary Search may be used, this has log2 N block accesses. Also since the data is sorted given a non-key field, the rest of the table doesn’t need to be searched for duplicate values, once a higher value is found. Thus the performance increase is substantial.

**What is indexing?**

Indexing is a way of sorting a number of records on multiple fields. Creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure which holds the field value, and pointer to the record it relates to. This index structure is then sorted, allowing Binary Searches to be performed on it.

The downside to indexing is that these indexes require additional space on the disk, since the indexes are stored together in a MyISAM database, this file can quickly reach the size limits of the underlying file system if many fields within the same table are indexed.

**How does it work?**

Firstly, let’s outline a sample database table schema; 
<pre>
Field name Data type Size on disk
id (Primary key) Unsigned INT 4 bytes
firstName Char(50) 50 bytes
lastName Char(50) 50 bytes
emailAddress Char(100) 100 bytes
Note: char was used in place of varchar to allow for an accurate size on disk value. 
This sample database contains five million rows, and is unindexed. The performance of several queries will now be analyzed. These are a query using the id (a sorted key field) and one using the firstName (a non-key unsorted field).
</pre>
***Example 1***

Given our sample database of r = 5,000,000 records of a fixed size giving a record length of R = 204 bytes and they are stored in a MyISAM database which is using the default block size B = 1,024 bytes. The blocking factor of the table would be bfr = (B/R) = 1024/204 = 5 records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the table is N = (r/bfr) = 5000000/5 = 1,000,000 blocks. 

A linear search on the id field would require an average of N/2 = 500,000 block accesses to find a value given that the id field is a key field. But since the id field is also sorted a binary search can be conducted requiring an average of log2 1000000 = 19.93 = 20 block accesses. Instantly we can see this is a drastic improvement.

Now the firstName field is neither sorted, so a binary search is impossible, nor are the values unique, and thus the table will require searching to the end for an exact N = 1,000,000 block accesses. It is this situation that indexing aims to correct.


Given that an index record contains only the indexed field and a pointer to the original record, it stands to reason that it will be smaller than the multi-field record that it points to. So the index itself requires fewer disk blocks that the original table, which therefore requires fewer block accesses to iterate through. The schema for an index on the firstName field is outlined below; 

<pre>
Field name Data type Size on disk
firstName Char(50) 50 bytes
(record pointer) Special 4 bytes
Note: Pointers in MySQL are 2, 3, 4 or 5 bytes in length depending on the size of the table.
</pre>
***Example 2***

Given our sample database of r = 5,000,000 records with an index record length of R = 54 bytes and using the default block size B = 1,024 bytes. The blocking factor of the index would be bfr = (B/R) = 1024/54 = 18 records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the table is N = (r/bfr) = 5000000/18 = 277,778 blocks. 

Now a search using the firstName field can utilise the index to increase performance. This allows for a binary search of the index with an average of log2 277778 = 18.08 = 19 block accesses. To find the address of the actual record, which requires a further block access to read, bringing the total to 19 + 1 = 20 block accesses, a far cry from the 1,000,000 block accesses required by the non-indexed table.

**When should it be used?**

Given that creating an index requires additional disk space (277,778 blocks extra from the above example), and that too many indexes can cause issues arising from the file systems size limits, careful thought must be used to select the correct fields to index.

Since indexes are only used to speed up the searching for a matching field within the records, it stands to reason that indexing fields used only for output would be simply a waste of disk space and processing time when doing an insert or delete operation, and thus should be avoided. Also given the nature of a binary search, the cardinality or uniqueness of the data is important. Indexing on a field with a cardinality of 2 would split the data in half, whereas a cardinality of 1,000 would return approximately 1,000 records. With such a low cardinality the effectiveness is reduced to a linear sort, and the query optimizer will avoid using the index if the cardinality is greater than 30% of the record number, effectively making the index a waste of space.##C##<databases><indexing><article>##C##@$R$@

It's a little different in that it will find and replace strings, rather than characters in the starting string.

It's trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length (or the replace string is shorter than the search string), since I have enough space allocated.  If I try to use realloc(), I get an error that tells me I am doing a double free - which I don't see how I am, since I am only using realloc().

Perhaps a little code will help:

    void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace) {
        int searchLen = strlen(search);
        int replaceLen = strlen(replace);
        int delta = replaceLen - searchLen;
        char *find = input;
        while (find = strstr(find, search)) {
            if (delta > 0) {
                realloc(input, strlen(input) + delta);
                find = strstr(input, search);            
            }
            memmove(find + replaceLen, find + searchLen, strlen(input) - (find - input));
            memmove(find, replace, replaceLen);
        }
    }

The program works, until I try to realloc() in an instance where the replaced string will be longer than the initial string.  (It still kind of works, it just spits out errors as well as the result).

If it helps, the calling code looks liks:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    
    void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace);

        while ((fgets(input, 81, stdin)) != NULL) {
            strrep(input, "Noel", "Christmas");

I primarily use ASP.NET / VB.NET with SQL Server 2000.

**Scenario**

I want to offer a dynamic permission system that can work on different parameters. Let's say that I want to give either a department or just a specific person access to an application. And pretend that we have a number of applications that keeps growing.

In the past, I have chosen one of the following two ways that I know to do this.

1. Use a single permission table with special columns that are used for determining a how to apply the parameters. The special columns in this example are TypeID and TypeAuxID. The SQL would look something like this. 
> SELECT COUNT(PermissionID) 
> FROM application_permissions 
> WHERE 
> (TypeID = 1 AND TypeAuxID = @UserID) OR 
> (TypeID = 2 AND TypeAuxID = @DepartmentID)
> AND ApplicationID = 1

2. Use a mapping table for each type of permission, then joining them all together.
> SELECT COUNT(perm.PermissionID) 
> FROM application_permissions perm
> LEFT JOIN application_UserPermissions emp ON perm.ApplicationID = emp.ApplicationID
> LEFT JOIN application_DepartmentPermissions dept ON perm.ApplicationID = dept.ApplicationID
> WHERE q.SectionID=@SectionID 
> AND (emp.UserID=@UserID OR dept.DeptID=@DeptID OR (emp.UserID IS NULL AND dept.DeptID IS NULL)) 
> AND ApplicationID = 1
> ORDER BY q.QID ASC

Anyway, here's the problem:

Let's say you have some class which wraps or includes networked file IO operations (e.g. reading and writing to some file at some particular UNC path somewhere). For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc.

The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic.

Here's an example code snippet:

    RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));
    bool success = false;
    while (!success)
    {
     try
     {
      // do some file IO which may succeed or fail
      success = true;
     }
     catch (IOException e)
     {
      if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)
      {
       throw e;
      }
      fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();
     }
    }

So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods:

    this.RetryFileIO( delegate()
        {
            // some code block
        } );


I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I'd like to hear how other people would solve this sort of problem.##C##<c#><exception><error-handling>##C##@$R$@

Our team uses Subversion for version control and we've been able to automate some of our tasks this way (pushing builds up to a staging server, deploying tested code to a production server) but we're still doing database updates manually.  I would like to find or create a solution that allows us to work efficiently across servers with different environments while continuing to use Subversion as a backend through which code and DB updates are pushed around to various servers.

Many popular software packages include auto-update scripts which detect DB version and apply the necessary changes.  Is this the best way to do this even on a larger scale (across multiple projects and sometimes multiple environments and languages)?  If so, is there any existing code out there that simplifies the process or is it best just to roll our own solution?  Has anyone implemented something similar before and integrated it into Subversion post-commit hooks, or is this a bad idea?

While a solution that supports multiple platforms would be preferable, we definitely need to support the Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP stack as the majority of our work is on that platform.##C##<database><php><mysql><subversion>##C##@$R$@

How do you decide what should be kept in the built in user Profile, or if you should just go and create your own DB Table and add a column for that?

The pros/cons I can think of are that since I don't know the profile so well, (it is a bit of a *Matrix* right now) I probably can do whatever I want if I go the table route (like, SQL to get all the users in the same zip code as the current user), I don't know ifI can do the same if I use the ASP.NET profile.##C##<asp.net><profile>##C##@$R$@

The users upload documents through a front-end application that is on the web. This application calls a web service of the back-end application and passes the document to it. The back-end app saves the document and inserts a row in the *Document* table.

The document type (7 possible document types: *Invoice*, *Contract* etc.) is passed as a parameter to the web service's *UploadDocument* method. The question is, what should the type (and possible values) of this parameter be?

Since you need to hardcode these values in both applications, I think it is O.K. to use a descriptive string (*Invoice*, *Contract*, *WorkOrder*, *SignedWorkOrder*). 

Is it maybe a better approach to create a *DocumentTypes* enumeration in the first application, and to reproduce it also in the second application, and then pass the corresponding integer value to the web service between them?##C##<web-service><application-integration>##C##@$R$@

I have an anchor tag in an ASP.NET Repeater control.  
The OnClick event of the anchor contains a call to a Javascript function.  
The Javascript funciton takes a string for it's input parameter.  
The string parameter is populated with a databound value from the Repeater.

I need the 'double quotes' for the Container.DataItem.  
I need the 'single quotes' for the OnClick.

And I still need *one more delimiter* (triple quotes?) for the input string parameter of the Javascript function call.

Since I can't use 'single quotes' again, how do I ensure the Javascript function knows the input parameter is a string and not an integer?

Without the extra quotes around the input string parameter, the Javascript function thinks I'm passing in an integer.

Cheers in advance for any knowledge you can drop.

    <a id="aShowHide" onclick='ToggleDisplay(<%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, "JobCode") %>);' >Show/Hide</a>

From the UI perspective, the DataContext is a design of the sections of your database that you would like to expose to through LinqToSql and is integral in setting up the ORM features of LinqToSql.

My question is: I am setting up a project that uses a large database where all tables are interconnected in some way through Foreign Keys. My first inclination is to make one huge DataContext class that models the entire datbase. That way I could in theory (though I don't know if this would be needed in practice) use the Foreign Key connections that are generated through LinqToSql to easily go between related objects in my code, insert related objects, etc.

However, after giving it some thought, I am now thinking that it may make more sense to create multiple DataContext classes, each one relating to a specific namespace or logical interrelated section within my database. My main concern is that instantiating and disposing one huge DataContext class all the time for individual operations that relate to specific areas of the Database would be impose an unnecessary imposition on application resources. Additionally, it is easier to create and manage smaller DataContext files than one big one. The thing that I would lose is that there would be some distant sections of the database that would not be navigable through LinqToSql (even though a chain of relationships connects them in the actual database). Additionally, there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one DataContext.

Any thoughts or experience on whether multiple DataContexts (corresponding to DB namespaces) are appropriate in place of (or in addition to) one very large DataContext class (corresponding to the whole DB)?

Some of the controls are hidden in dialog-style DIVs, so I'd like to have them load in via AJAX only when the user wants to see them.  This is fine for controls that are mostly Literal-based (various menus and widgets), but when I have what I call "dirty" controls - ones that write extensive information to the ViewState, put tons of CSS or script on the page, require lots of references etc - these are seemingly impossible to move "out of page", especially considering how ASP.NET will react on postback.

I was considering some kind of step where I override Render, find markers for the bits I want to move out and put AJAX placeholders in there, but not only does the server overhead seem extreme, it also feels like a complete hack.  Besides, the key element here is the dialog boxes that contain forms with validation controls on them, and I can't imagine how I would move the controls _and_ their required scripts.

Short version: I need some way to update the page ViewState after an async callback has been made, to reflect any state changes the server made during the async call. 

This seems to be a common problem, but I will describe my scenario to help explain:

I have a grid-like control which has some JavaScript enhancements - namely, the ability to drag and drop columns and rows. When a column or row is dropped into a new position, an AJAX method is invoked to notify the control server-side and fire a corresponding server-side event ("OnColumnMoved" or "OnRowMoved").

ASP.NET AJAX calls, by default, send the entire page as the request. That way the page goes through a complete lifecycle, viewstate is persisted and the state of the control is restored before the RaiseCallbackEvent method is invoked.

However, since the AJAX call does not update the page, the ViewState reflects the *original* state of the control, even after the column or row has been moved. So the second time a client-side action occurs, the AJAX request goes to the server and the page & control are built back up again to reflect the *first* state of the control, not the state after the first column or row was moved.

This problem extends to many implications. For example if we have a client-side/AJAX action to add a new item to the grid, and then a row is dragged, the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side.

And finally & most seriously for my specific example, the actual data source object we are acting upon is stored in the page ViewState. That was a design decision to allow keeping a stateful copy of the manipulated data which can either be committed to DB after many manipulations or discarded if the user backs out. That is very difficult to change.

So, again, I need a way for the page ViewState to be updated on callback after the AJAX method is fired.##C##<asp.net><ajax><viewstate>##C##@$R$@

I have all information about the layout of the data in the files I want to read. I'm able to read the data "chunk by chunk", i.e. getting the first 40 bytes of data converting it to a string, get the next 40 bytes, ...

Since there are at least three slighlty different version of the data, I would like to read the data directly into a struct. It just feels so much more right than by reading it "line by line".

I have tried the following approach but to no avail:

    StructType aStruct;
    int count = Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(StructType));
    byte[] readBuffer = new byte[count];
    BinaryReader reader = new BinaryReader(stream);

    handle.Free();

The stream is an opened FileStream from which I have began to read from. I get an AccessViolationException when using Marshal.PtrToStructure.

The stream contains more information than I'm trying to read since I'm not interested in data at the end of the file.

The struct is defined like:

Specifically, I have been writing web apps in PHP and would like to use YUI to improve the pages I am writing, but a lot of them seem very JavaScript based, with most of the donkey work being done using JavaScript.

Anyone have some good places to start using this idea, I don't really care about the language.

If I statically assign an IP to the VM I can SSH to it, but for now I need to be able to use DHCP to give it an address (and since that's what I'm trying to debug, there's the problem). I know I've got a free DHCP address (although I'm getting more at the moment), so I don't think that's the problem. I've looked on Google and the Xen forums to no avail as well.

Any ideas?

I would like to have a main processing thread (non GUI), and be able to spin off GUIs in their own background threads as needed, and having my main non GUI thread keep working. Put another way, I want my main non GUI-thread to be the owner of the GUI-thread and not vice versa. I'm not sure this is even possible with Windows Forms(?)

**Background**

I have a component based system in which a controller dynamically load assemblies and instantiates and run classes implementing a common _IComponent_ interface with a single method _DoStuff()_ .

It would be great if these components were allowed to start up their own Windows Forms GUIs.

**Problem**

When a component tries to fire up a GUI in _DoStuff()_ (the exact line of code is when the component runs Application.Run(theForm)) , the component and hence our system "hangs" at the Application.Run() line until the GUI is closed. Well, the just fired up GUI works fine, as expected.

Example of components. One hasn't nothing to do with GUI, whilst the second fires up a cute windows with pink fluffy bunnies in them.

    public class MyComponent1: IComponent
    {
        public string DoStuff(...) { // write something to the database  }
    }

    public class MyComponent2: IComponent
        public void DoStuff()
        {
            Application.EnableVisualStyles();
            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
            Application.Run(new Form());

            // I want the thread to immediately return after the GUI 
            // is fired up, so that my main thread can continue to work.
        }
    }

I have tried this with no luck.

        public void DoStuff()
        {
               new Thread(ThreadedInitialize).Start()
        }

        private void ThreadedInitialize()

            Application.EnableVisualStyles();
            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
            Application.Run(new Form());
        }

I am migrating to JXTA 2.5 and in the process I am trying to clean up a lot of my use of JXTA. For the most part, I approached JXTA with a "just make it work" attitude. I used it to jumpstart creating and managing my peer-to-peer overlay network and providing basic communication services. I would like to use it in a more "JXTA" way since I am making changes to move to 2.5 anyway.

My first step would be a basic creation of a custom PeerGroup. I see some new new mechanisms that are using the META-INF.services infrastructure of Java. Should I be listing a related PeerGroup implementing object here with a GUID in net.jxta.platform.Module? As I understand it, if I do this, when a group with a spec ID matching the GUID is encountered and joined or created it should automatically use the matching object. I should be able to just manually tie a PeerGroup object to the group but this new method using META-INF seems to be a lot easier to manage.

Does anyone have any pointers or examples of using this infrastructure for PeerGroup implementation? Also, some general information on the META-INF.services mechanism in Java would be helpful.

You also have installed MS Office 2003+ and configured MS Office Document Imaging (MODI) correctly so you can perform OCR on your images and even embed the OCR'd text into TIFFs.

Awesomeness: Indexing Service is able to index and find those TIFFs that you manually OCR'd and re-saved with text data (using MS Document Imaging tool).

Suck(TM): Whatever you do, you cannot make the Indexing Service to OCR and index the TIFF files without text data. You scour the web, find out how to turn on MODI debugging, and see that CISVC *is* calling MODI but somehow nothing seems to happen.

Hack: Turns out, Data Execution Prevention (DEP) which is deployed with Windows XP SP2 thinks MODI is malicious and refuses to let it do its magic. I have been able to remove the Suck(TM) by turning DEP off completely, but (even though DEP hasn't yet saved my posterior that I can remember) I found this solution to be inelegant (read: the customer's IT manager's gonna fry you, if xe hears about it).

I'll share a better solution here, if I can come across it.##C##<ocr><dep><cisvc><indexingservice><modi>##C##@$R$@

What should I do?##C##My dad called me today and said people going to his website were getting 168 viruses trying to download to their computers. He isn't technical at all, and built the whole thing with a WYSIWYG editor.

I popped his site open and viewed the source, and there was a line of Javascript includes at the bottom of the source right before the closing HTML tag. They included this file (among many others): http://www.98hs.ru/js.js <-- TURN OFF JAVASCRIPT BEFORE YOU GO TO THAT URL.

So I commented it out for now. It turns out his ftp password was a plain dictionary word six letters long, so we think that's how it got hacked. We've changed his password to an 8+ digit non-word string (he wouldn't go for a passphrase since he is a hunt-n-peck typer).

I did a [whois on 98hs.ru][1] and found it is hosted from a server in Chili. There is actually an e-mail address associated with it too, but I seriously doubt this person is the culprit. Probably just some other site that got hacked...

I have no idea what to do at this point though as I've never dealt with this sort of thing before. Anyone have any suggestions?

He was using plain jane un-secured ftp through webhost4life.com. I don't even see a way to *do* sftp on their site. I'm thinking his username and password got intercepted?

**So, to make this more relevant to the community, what are the steps you should take/best practices you should follow to protect your website from getting hacked?**

For the record, here is the line of code that "magically" got added to his file (and isn't in his file on his computer -- I've left it commented out just to make absolute sure it won't do anything on this page, although I'm sure Jeff would guard against this):

I.e.:

    /appRoot/.htaccess
             app/
             static/

By default every request to /appRoot/* is being rewritten to be picked up by app/webroot/index.php, where it's being analysed and corresponding controller actions are being invoked. This is done by these directives in .htaccess:

    RewriteBase    /appRoot
    
    RewriteRule    ^$ app/webroot/    [L]
    RewriteRule    (.*) app/webroot/$1 [L]

I now want to exclude a few directories like static/ from this rewriting. I tried with this *before* the Cake RewriteRules:

    RewriteCond    $1 ^(static|otherDir).*$ [NC]
    RewriteRule    (.*) - [L]

It works in so far that requests are no longer rewritten, but now **all** requests are being skipped, even legitimate Cake requests which should not match ^(static|otherDir).*$.

I tried several variations of these rules but can't get it to work the way I want.##C##<.htaccess><apache><mod-rewrite>##C##@$R$@

It helps us to measure how (in)efficient an algorithm really is and if you know in [what category the problem you are trying to solve lays in][2] you can figure out if it is still possible to squeeze out that little extra performance.*

But I'm curious, how do *you* calculate or approximate the complexity of your algorithms?

To find the peak value we currently search the array for the highest reading and use the index to determine the timing of the peak value which is used in our calculations.

This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period.

My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system. Is this the best way to proceed or are there better techniques?##C##<language-agnostic><algorithm><data>##C##@$R$@

* Data is retrieved from external webservices
* Data is stored in SQL 2005
* Data is manipulated via a web GUI
* The windows service that communicates with the web services has no coupling with our internal web UI, except via the database.
* Communication with the web services needs to be both time-based, and triggered via user intervention on the web UI.

The current (pre-pre-production) model for web service communication triggering is via a database table that stores trigger requests generated from the manual intervention.  I do not really want to have multiple trigger mechanisms, but would like to be able to populate the database table with triggers based upon the time of the call.  As I see it there are two ways to accomplish this.

1) Adapt the trigger table to store two extra parameters.  One being "Is this time-based or manually added?" and a nullable field to store the timing details (exact format to be determined).  If it is a manaully created trigger, mark it as processed when the trigger has been fired, but not if it is a timed trigger.  
_or_  
2) Create a second windows service that creates the triggers on-the-fly at timed intervals.

The second option seems like a fudge to me, but the management of option 1 could easily turn into a programming nightmare (how do you know if the last poll of the table returned the event that needs to fire, and how do you then stop it re-triggering on the next poll)

I'd appreciate it if anyone could spare a few minutes to help me decide which route (one of these two, or possibly a third, unlisted one) to take.

        textBox.Height = height;
    }

But of course the compiler spits its dummy, because *foreach* expects an IEnumerable rather than an IEnumerator.

Is there a way to do this without having to create a separate class with a GetEnumerator() method?

Am I mad?

 1. Splitting the page so that credit card collection (the requirement for SSL) is not on the same page as the Google Map.
 2. Switching to another map provider, such as Virtual Earth.  Rumor has it that they support SSL.
 3. Playing tricks with IFRAMEs.  Sounds kludgy.
 4. Proxying the calls to Google.  Sounds like a lot of overhead.

Are there other options, or does anyone have insight into the options that we have considered?

Precisely, I don't want users automating access to forms issuing direct GET/POST HTTP requests to the appropriate servlet. 

So, I decided to block users based on the value of HTTP_REFERER. After all, if the user is navigating inside the site, it will have an appropriate HTTP_REFERER. Well, that was what I thought. 

I implemented a rewrite rule in the .htaccess file that says: 

    RewriteEngine on 
    
    # Options +FollowSymlinks
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://mywebaddress(.cl)?/.* [NC]
    RewriteRule (servlet1|servlet2)/.+\?.+ - [F]

I expected to forbid access to users that didn't navigate the site but issue direct GET requests to the "servlet1" or "servlet2" servlets using querystrings. But my expectations ended abruptly because the regular expression "(servlet1|servlet2)/.+\?.+" didn't worked at all. 

I get really disappointed when I changed that expr to "(servlet1|servlet2)/.+" and worked so well that my users were blocked no matter if they navigated the site or not. 

So, my question is: How do I can accomplish this thing of not allowing "robots" with direct access to certain pages if I have no access/privileges/time to modify the application?##C##<security><apache><mod-rewrite><http-referer>##C##@$R$@

Downsides to ClickOnce:

  - Consists of multiple files - Seems easier to distribute one file than manageing a bunch of file and the downloader to download those files.
  - You have to build it again for CD installations (for when the end user dosn't have internet)
  - Program does not end up in Program Files - It ends up hidden away in some application catch folder, making it much harder to shortcut to.

Pros to ClickOnce:

  - It works. Magically. And it's built
    into VisualStudio 2008 express.
  - Makes it easy to upgrade the
    application.

Does Windows Installer do these things as well? I know it dosen't have any of the ClickOnce cons, but It would be nice to know if it also has the ClickOnce pros.##C##<visual-studio><vb.net><installer><clickonce>##C##@$R$@

The function of the application is simply a pass-through for data from a serial device to a file. It performs many, many transformations on the data before writing it to the file, so the GUI for the application is simply all the settings that dictate what those transformations should be.

What's the best way to go about designing/coding a tree-view preferences dialog? The way I've been going about it is building the main window with a docked tree control on the left. Then I have been creating container controls that correspond to each node of the tree. When a node is selected, the app brings that node's corresponding container control to the front, moves it to the right position, and maximizes it in the main window. This seems really, really clunky while designing it. It basically means I have tons of container controls beyond the edge of the main window during design time that I have to keep scrolling the main window over to in order to work with them. I don't know if this totally makes sense the way I'm writing this, but maybe this visual for what I'm talking about will make more sense:

![form design][1]

Basically I have to work with this huge form, with container controls all over the place, and then do a bunch of run-time reformatting to make it all work. This seems like a *lot* of extra work. Am I doing this in a totally stupid way? Is there some "obvious" easier way of doing this that I'm missing?

What do people do?##C##Currently I have two linux servers wunning MySQL, one sitting on a rack right next to me under a 10Mbit upload pipe (main server) and another some couple of miles away on a 3Mbit upload pipe (mirror).

I want to be able to replicate data on both servers continuously, but have run into several roadblocks. One of them being, under MySQL master/slave configurations, every now and then, some statements drop (!), meaning; some people logging on to the mirror URL don't see data that I know is on the main server and vice versa. Lets say this happens on a meaningful block of data once every month, so I can live with it and assume its a "lost packet" issue (i.e., god knows, but we'll compensate).

The other most important (and annoying) recurring issue is that, when for some reason we do a major upload or update (or reboot) on one end and have to sever the link, then LOAD DATA FROM MASTER doesn't work and I have to manually dump on one end and upload on the other, quite a task nowadays moving some .5TB worth of data.

Is there software for this? I know MySQL (the "corporation") offers this as a VERY expensive service (full DB replication). Just wondering what people out there do. The way its structured, we run an automatic failover where if one server is not up, then the main URL just resolves to the other server.

While effective, the data in the audit table is not the most useful or simple to report off of.  I'm wondering if anyone has a better method for auditing data changes?##C##<database><sql-server><db><audit>##C##@$R$@

Is there any way to prioritize these so that results come as all for query #1, then all for query #2 then all for query #3? I don't want to do this in PHP just yet (not to mention having to control for results that showed up in the first query not to show in the second and so forth).

The problem is one of our project is now using an integrated Visual Studio Setup project (vdproj) and has recently been ported to Visual Studio 2008. Unfortunatly, those won't build in MSBuild and calling devenv.exe /build on 2008 just crashes, apparently it does that on all multi core computer (!!!). So now I have the choice to either rollback to .Net 2.0 and 2005 or simply ditch Visual Studio deployement, but first, I'd like a second opinion.

One of the reports shows missing (recommended) indexes. I think it's based on some system view that is maintained by the query optimizer.

My question is what is the best way to determine when to take an index recommendation. I know that it doesn't make sense to apply all of the optimizer's suggestions. I see a lot of advice that basically says to try the index and to keep it if performance improves and to drop it if performances degrades or stays the same.

The problem is, my G5 does not have a serial port, so I have to use a usb to serial dongle. It shows up as /dev/cu.usbserial and /dev/tty.usbserial . 

When i do this everything seems to be hunky-dory:

Everything also works when I use the <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/24024">serial port tool</a> to talk to it.

If I run this piece of code while the above mentioned serial port tool, everthing also works. But as soon as I disconnect the tool the connection gets lost. 

    #!/usr/bin/python
    
    import serial
    
    ser = serial.Serial('/dev/cu.usbserial', 9600, timeout=10)

    print read_chars
    
    ser.close()

When I the class documentation, it describes various types of authentication (basic, digest, Windows, etc.) - none of them refer to SSL.

I understand that the standard version of MSSQLExpress does not have full-text indexing. I have already downloaded and installed "MSSQL 2005 Express with Advanced Services" ([download][1]).

I have also ensured that both the "SQL Server (instance)" and "SQL Server FullText Search (instance)" services are running on the same account which is "Network Service".

I have also selected the option to "Use full-text indexing" in the Database Properties > Files area.

I can run the sql query "SELECT fulltextserviceproperty('IsFulltextInstalled');" and return 1.

The problem I am having is that when I have my table open in design view and select "Manage FullText Index"; the full-text index window displays the message...

As the user changes settings using the app's UI (clicking checkboxes, choosing radio buttons, etc.), I plan to be writing those changes out to the AppSettings. At the same time, while the program is running I plan to be accessing the AppSettings constantly from a process that will be constantly processing data. Changes to settings via the UI need to affect the data processing in real-time, which is why the process will be accessing the AppSettings constantly.

Is this a good idea with regard to performance? Using AppSettings is supposed to be "the right way" to store and access configuration settings when writing .Net apps, but I worry that this method wasn't intended for a constant load (at least in terms of settings being constantly read).

There is some great integration with Visual Studio, and lots of great tools for DBA's, testers, project managers, etc.

The most obvious difference between these two products is price.  It's hard to beat Subversion (free).  Team Foundation Server is quite expensive, so the extra features would really have to kick Subversion in the pants.

My question is: does anyone have practical experience with both?  How do they compare, and is Team Foundation Server actually worth all the money?

I have looked in the past and the best I could find were vague references to Voronoi diagrams.  An example of a Voronoi diagram is [here][1].

These hold promise, but I guess i haven't seen any straight-forward ways of rendering these, yet alone holding them in some form of data structure to treat each territory as an object.

Another approach that holds promise is flood fill, but again I'm unsure on the best way to start with this approach.

This fails with the error:

Now, I get that primitives are not reference types (ie, not an Object) and so cannot have methods.  However, Java 5 introduced autoboxing and unboxing (a la C#... which I never liked in C#, but that's beside the point).  So with autoboxing, I would expect the above to convert myInt to an Integer and then call toString() on that.

Furthermore, I believe C# allows such a call, unless I remember incorrectly.  Is this just an unfortunate shortcoming of Java's autoboxing/unboxing specification, or is there a good reason for this?##C##<java><primitive><autoboxing>##C##@$R$@

Now, I use those objects in both script.php and /soap/soap.php, I could move them, but I want the directory structure like that for a different reason.

Aside from a tiny bit of testing, I have never used Vista, but overall I have heard many more bad reports than good regarding Vista. I don't think that hardware will be an issue (Intel Core Duo T9300, 4GB RAM, 256MB NVIDIA) in terms of performance. I am just uneasy about using Vista for my main dev system given its history, when I have the opportunity to keep on using XP.

So is there anyone here who has experience with both Vista and XP as the OS on your dev machine? If you could choose one over the other, which would you go with?

       Assert.AreEqual(mockResults, new List<IAnimal>(zoo.Animals));

I don't like how I got it to work for the following reasons:

  - Had to consume the IEnumerable<IAnimal> results into IList<IAnimal>, I understand this puts the results for checking onto the heap
  - Had to setup the contents of the results ... I understand this as well, but my main point is to test that Zoo.Animals is returning IEnumerable<IAnimal>, and even better, that we're using "yield return" inside

Is there a way to tell the ConfigurationManager to just load the configuration from an arbitrary path (e.g. "..\web.config" if my assembly is in the /bin folder)?

environment. Thankfully this is not production ;) The problems started
when the disk with the SQL Server databases and search index ran out
of space. Following this, the search service would not run and search
settings in the SSP were not accessible. Reclaiming the disk space did
not resolve the issue. So rather than restoring the VM, we decided to
try to fix the issue.

We created a new SSP and changed the association of all services to
the new SSP. The old SSP and it's databases were then deleted. Search
results for PDF files are no longer appearing, but the search works
fine otherwise. MySites also works OK.

Following the implementation of this change, these problems occur:

1) An audit failure message started appearing in the application event
log, for 'DOMAIN\SPMOSSSvc' which is the MOSS farm account.

Event Type: Failure Audit
Event Source: MSSQLSERVER
Event Category: (4)
Event ID: 18456
Date: 8/5/2008
Time: 3:55:19 PM
User: DOMAIN\SPMOSSSvc
Computer: dastest01
Description:
Login failed for user 'DOMAIN\SPMOSSSvc'. [CLIENT: <local machine>]

2) SQL Server profiler is showing queries from SharePoint that reference the old
(deleted) SSP database.

So...

* Where would these references to DOMAIN\SPMOSSSvc and the old SSP
database exist?
* Is there a way to 'completely' remove the SSP from the server, and
re-create? The option to delete was not available (greyed out) when a
single SSP is in place.##C##<sql-server><database><sharepoint><search><ssp>##C##@$R$@

I'm new to regular expressions and I was suggested to use this:

    static Regex rText = new Regex(@"\e\[[\d;]+m", RegexOptions.Compiled);

However, this failed if the escape code was incomplete due to an error on the server. So then this was suggested, but my friend warned it might be slower (this one also matches another condition (z) that I might come across later):

    static Regex rTest = new Regex(@"(\e(\[([\d;]*[mz]?))?)?", RegexOptions.Compiled);

It works.. beautifully! looks elegant and is way more complete than any regular dropdown (those results div bring in a lot of information).

However, I'm missing the most of important functions behind regular HTML elements, that is, I can't keyboard down or up between "options". How do I do this? I know javascript handles keyboard events but; I haven't been able to find a good guide on how to do this. (of course the follow up question to this will eventually end up being: "can I use <ENTER> to trigger that onclick event)

Phew!

*Are we sure that this is actually an example of widening instead of autoboxing?*

  On my initial scanning, i would agree with the statement that the output would be "long" on the basis of i being a primitive and not an object

The reason for that is that the current developers are heavy on Java but felt the need for a MVC-style language for some future web development projects. Personally, I'm coming from the design/usability world, but as I take more "front-end" responsibilities I'm starting to feel the need for learning a language more intensively so I can code some logic but especially the front-end code for my UIs and stuff.

I've been trying to get into Python/Django personally, but just never invested too much time on it. Now that my company is "jumping" into Grails I bought the "Agile Web Development with Rails (3rd Ed - Beta)" and I'm starting to get into RoR. I'd still like to learn Python in the future or on the side, but my biggest question is: 

- Should I be learning RoR, and have a more versatile language in my "portfolio", knowing that my RoR knowledge will be useful for my Grails needs as well??

-OR-
 
- Should I just skip RoR and focus on learning Grails that I'll be needing for work soon, and work on learning RoR/Django (Ruby/Python) later?


Basically the question revolves around the usefulness of Grails in a non-corporate setting and the similarities between Rails and Grails. (and this, while trying to avoid the centennial discussion of Python vs Ruby (on Rails) :) hehe)

My specific case is that I have a mock class for a test.  There is no default constructor, but I want one to make the tests simpler to read.  I also want to wrap the exceptions thrown from the constructor into a RuntimeException.

So, what I want to do is effectively this:

    public class MyClassMock extends MyClass {

            }
        }

        // Mocked methods
    }

But Java complains that super isn't the first statement.

My workaround:

    public class MyClassMock extends MyClass {
        public static MyClassMock construct() {
            try {
                return new MyClassMock();

            super(0);
        }

I want to assign a variable the value out of an attribute (easy so far) then use that variable to select another node based on the value of that attribute.

That does not work.  If I replace the {@myId} with the value that is in the variable then it does find the right node, but doign it this way produces nothing.  I'm sure I'm missing something, or perhaps there is a different way to do it.

The context is that there is related data under different top-level nodes that share the same id value so I need to get the related nodes in my template.##C##<xslt>##C##@$R$@

OK, I've been developing a site using ASP.NET MVC, and have decided to use the new SQL Server 2008 FILESTREAM facility to store files 'within' the database rather than as separate entities.  While initially working within VS2008 (using a trusted connection to the database), everything was fine and dandy.  Issues arose, however, when I shifted the site to IIS7 and changed over to SQL authentication on the database.

It seems that streaming a FILESTREAM doesn't work with SQL authentication, only with Windows authentication.  Given this, what is the best practice to follow?

 1. Is there a way to force this wort of thing to work under SQL authentication?
 2. Should I add NETWORK SERVICE as a database user and then use Trusted authentication?
 3. Should I create another user, and run both the IIS site and the database connection under this?
 4. Any other suggestions?

So, my feeling is that the only reason you would even consider using J# is that management has decreed that the company should jump on the Java bandwagon... and the .NET bandwagon.  If you use J#, you are effectively losing the biggest benefit of picking Java... rich cross platform support.  Sure there is Mono, but it's not as richly supported or as full featured right?  I remember hearing Forms are not fully (perhaps at all) supported.

I'm not trying to bash .NET here, I'm just saying, if you are going to go the Microsoft route, why not just use C#?  If you are going to go the Java route, why would J# enter the picture?

I'm hoping to find some real world cases here, so please especially respond if you've ACTUALLY used J# in a REAL project, and why.

Because guids are non-sequential (and they're client-side generated so I can't use newsequentialid()), I have made a non-primary, non-clustered index on this ID field rather than giving the tables a clustered primary key.

I'm wondering what the performance implications are for this approach. I've seen some people suggest that tables should have an auto-incrementing ("identity") int as a clustered primary key even if it doesn't have any meaning, as it means that the database engine itself can use that value to quickly look up a row instead of having to use a bookmark.

My database is merge-replicated across a bunch of servers, so I've shied away from identity int columns as they're a bit hairy to get right in replication.

What are your thoughts? Should tables have primary keys? Or is it ok to not have any clustered indexes if there are no sensible columns to index that way?##C##<mssql><indexing>##C##@$R$@

Basically, compare two files (designated *old* and *new*), and produce a patch file that can be used to upgrade the *old* file to have the same contents as the *new* file.

The implementation would have to be relatively fast, and work with huge files. It should exhibit O(n) or O(logn) runtimes.

My own algorithms tend to either be lousy (fast but produce huge patches) or slow (produce small patches but have O(n^2) runtime).

Any advice, or pointers for implementation would be nice.

Specifically, the implementation will be used to keep servers in sync for various large datafiles that we have one master server for. When the master server datafiles change, we need to update several off-site servers as well.

The most naive algorithm I have made, which only works for files that can be kept in memory, is as follows:

1. Grab the first four bytes from the *old* file, call this the *key*
2. Add those bytes to a dictionary, where *key -> position*, where *position* is the position where I grabbed those 4 bytes, 0 to begin with
3. Skip the first of these four bytes, grab another 4 (3 overlap, 1 one), and add to the dictionary the same way
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all 4-byte blocks in the *old* file
5. From the start of the *new* file, grab 4 bytes, and attempt to look it up in the dictionary
6. If found, find the longest match if there are several, by comparing bytes from the two files
7. Encode a reference to that location in the *old* file, and skip the matched block in the *new* file
8. If not found, encode 1 byte from the *new* file, and skip it
9. Repeat steps 5-8 for the rest of the *new* file

This is somewhat like compression, without windowing, so it will use a lot of memory. It is, however, fairly fast, and produces quite small patches, as long as I try to make the codes output minimal.

A more memory-efficient algorithm uses windowing, but produces much bigger patch files.

There are more nuances to the above algorithm that I skipped in this post, but I can post more details if necessary. I do, however, feel that I need a different algorithm altogether, so improving on the above algorithm is probably not going to get me far enough.##C##<c#><patchgeneration><file>##C##@$R$@

I moved the tables from a simple MS Access database to MySQL using its [Migration Toolkit][1] (which works well, by the way) and set up Access to link to those tables via ODBC.

So far, I've run into the following:

   * You can't insert/update/delete rows in a table without a primary key (no surprise there).
   * AutoNumber fields in MS Access must be the primary key or they'll just end up as integer columns in MySQL (natch, why wouldn't it be the PK?)
   * The tables were migrated to MySQL's InnoDB table type, but the Access relationships didn't become MySQL foreign key constraints.

Once the database is in use, can I expect any other issues? Particularly when both users are working in the same table?

I've managed to get the services to run correctly for 3.0 and greater clients, but when I publish the services using a basicHttpBinding endpoint (which I believe is required for the compatibility I need), the service refactors my method signatures.  e.g.

>public bool MethodToReturnTrue(string seedValue);

appears to the client apps as

>public void MethodToReturnTrue(string seedValue, out bool result, out bool MethodToReturnTrueResultSpecified);

I've tried every configuration parameter I can think of in the app.config for my self-hosting console app, but I can't seem to make this function as expected.  I suppose this might lead to the fact that my expectations are flawed, but I'd be surprised that a WCF service is incapable of handling a bool return type to a down-level client.

I've stripped out most of the files and got it down to the bare minimum to generate the error. Unfortunately I can't post the project as this is used in production code.

The LNK2001 linker error I get usually means I've left off a library or forgot to implement a virtual function. However this is part of the standard template library - and is a header at that.

The code that is listed as having the problem in IOCompletionPort.obj doesn't actually use std::string directly, but does call a class that does: Comms::Exception accepts a std::string and the value of GetLastError or WSAGetLastError.

The function mentioned in the error (GetMessage) is implemented, but is a virtual function so other classes can override it if need be. However it appears that the compiler has made it as an Ansi version, but I can't find any options in the settings that would control that. I suspect that might be the problem but since there's very little in the way of options for the library I have no way of knowing for sure. However both projects to specify _MBCS in the compiler options.

But when using a [REST][1] or Rails-like URL scheme for object instances, I'd then end up with URLs like this:

    http://example.com/user/783

And then the assumption is that there are also users with IDs of 782, 781, ..., 2, and 1. Assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization, a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also "leaks" the total number of instances (older than this one), in this case users, which might be privileged information.

Would a [UUID][2]/GUID be a better solution? Then I could set up URLs like this:

    http://example.com/user/035a46e0-6550-11dd-ad8b-0800200c9a66

Not exactly succinct, but there's less implied information about users on display. Sure, it smacks of "security through obscurity" which is no substitute for proper security, but it seems at least a little more secure.

Is that benefit worth the cost and complexity of implementing UUIDs for web-addressable object instances? I think that I'd still want to use integer columns as database PKs just to speed up joins.

There's also the question of in-database representation of UUIDs. I know MySQL stores them as 36-character strings. Postgres seems to have a more efficient internal representation (128 bits?) but I haven't tried it myself. Anyone have any experience with this?

The current code can be found [here](http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py).

It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:

    print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1


What is the "best" way to abstract this data in the Tvdb() class?

I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do `x[1][2][3][4] = "something"` without having to do `if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []` and so on)

This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception)

Currently it's using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a `__setitem__`, `__getitem_` and `has_key`

This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.

The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the __getitem__ and __setitem__ functions, it's easy to accidently recursively call __getitem__ (so I'm not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)

The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was `self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'`). See _setItem and _setData. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly.. elegant..

I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the ShowContainer/etc classes with Dict cause problems?##C##<python><datastructure>##C##@$R$@

The DLL currently has the database connection string hard coded, but I don't want to do this when we launch as the assembly can be disassembled and the username and password would be right there in the open.

One of the requirements is that the password needs to be changed once every few months, so we would need to roll that out to our internal user base.

Is there a way to store the password encrypted in such a way we can easily distribute to the entire user base without storing it in the assembly?

Here's our setup. Each developer has a virtual machine running our app and the MySQL database. It is their personal sandbox to do whatever they want. Currently, developers will make a change to the SQL schema and do a dump of the database to a text file that they commit into SVN.

We're wanting to deploy a continuous integration development server that will always be running the latest committed code. If we do that now, it will reload the database from SVN for each build.

We have a test (virtual) server that runs "release candidates." Deploying to the test server is currently a very manual process, and usually involves me loading the latest SQL from SVN and tweaking it. Also, the data on the test server is inconsistent. You end up with whatever test data the last developer to commit had on his sandbox server.

Where everything breaks down is the deployment to production. Since we can't overwrite the live data with test data, this involves manually re-creating all the schema changes. If there were a large number of schema changes or conversion scripts to manipulate the data, this can get really hairy.

If the problem was just the schema, It'd be an easier problem, but there is "base" data in the database that is updated during development as well, such as meta-data in security and permissions tables.

I'm working to implement an export feature for events. The link above lists tons of clients that support the ICalendar standard, but the "three big ones" I can see are Apple's iCal, Microsoft's Outlook, and Google's Gmail.

I'm starting to get the feeling that each of these client implement different parts of the "standard", and I'm unsure of what pieces of information we should be trying to export from the application so that someone can put it on their calendar (especially around recurrence).

For example, from what I understand Outlook doesn't support daily recurrence (an event happens more than once per day).

Could any of you provide guidance of the "happy medium" here from a features implementation standpoint?

Secondary question, if we decide to cut features from the export (such as daily recurrence) because it isn't supported in Outlook, should we support it in the application as well? (it is a general purpose event scheduling application, with no business specific use in mind...so we really are looking for the happy medium).

Thanks,

Rather than the Pacific time zone.

I am running on Ubuntu Hardy Heron, upgraded from Gutsy Gibbon.

Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information?  The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn't seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration.

Other options?##C##I've been using a lot of new .NET 3.5 features in the work that I've been doing, lately. The application that I'm building is intended for distribution among consumers who will probably not have the latest version (or perhaps *any version*) of the .NET framework on their machines.

I went to go [download the .NET 3.5 redistributable package][1] only to find out that it's almost ***200 MB!*** This is unacceptable for my application, because it's supposed to be a quick and painless consumer application that installs quickly and keeps a low profile on the user's machine. For users that have .NET 3.5 already installed, our binary downloads have been instantaneous, so far. This 200 MB gorilla will more than quadruple the size of the download. Is there any other option than this redistributable package that I can use to make sure the framework is on the machine that won't take the user out of our "quick and painless" workflow? Our target time from beginning of download to finalizing the install is less than two minutes. Is it just not possible for someone who doesn't already have .NET installed?

It should enable the radio buttons if you select the "Enable both radio buttons" option.  These both work...

However, if you don't use your mouse to move between the 2 options ("Enable..." and "Disable...") then the radio buttons do not appear to be disabled or enabled correctly, until you click anywhere else on the page (not on the radio buttons themselves).

I changed the output directory to target/win_x32/release/results but the path in sgen doesn't seem to have been updated.  There seems to be no reference in the project to what path is passed into sgen so I'm unsure how to fix it.

So, my question:

I am still kinda new to the ASP.NET world, so I could be way off base here, but so far this is to the best of my (limited) knowledge!

Lets say I have a standard business object.. "Contact" in the *Business* namespace.. I write a Web Service to retrieve a Contact's info from a database, and return it. I then write a client application to request said details.

Now, I also then create a utility method that takes a "Contact" and does some magic with it, like *Utils.BuyContactNewHat()* say.. Which of course takes the Contact of type *Business.Contact*.

I then go back to my client application and want to utilise the *BuyContactNewHat* method, so I add a reference to my *Utils* namespace and there it is. However, a problem arises with:

    Contact c = MyWebService.GetContact("Rob);
    Utils.BuyContactNewHat(c); // << Error Here

Since the return type of *GetContact* is of *MyWebService.Contact* and not *Business.Contact* as expected.  
I understand why this is, because when accessing a web service, you are actually programming against the proxy class generated by the WSDL..  

So, is there an "easier" way to deal with this type mismatch? I was considering perhaps trying to create a generic converter class that uses reflection to ensure two objects have the same structure, then simply transferring the values across from one to the other..

How do you people overcome this (I'm sure common) problem?  I'm thinking of things like images on buttons and perhaps most important of all, the actual application icon.

Do you rely on third party designers, in or out of house?  Or do you know of some hidden website that offers lots of icons for us to use?

I am really fond of technologies that Java offers - particularly Spring Framework and Wicket and I am quite familiar with Java from others projects and assignments before.

A quick simple overview:  A .xfdl file is a is a gzipped .xml file which has then been encoded in base64.  I wish to de-encode the .xfdl into xml which I can then modify and then re-encode.

I have been able to take a .xfdl file and de-encode it from base64 using uudeview:

    uudeview -i yourform.xfdl

Then decommpressed it using gunzip

    gunzip -S "" < UNKNOWN.001 > yourform-unpacked.xml

The xml produced is 100% readable and looks wonderful.  Without modifying the xml then, i should be able to re-compress it using gzip:

    gzip yourform-unpacked.xml

Then re-encoded in base-64:

    base64 -e yourform-unpacked.xml.gz yourform_reencoded.xfdl

If my thinking is correct, the original file and the re-encoded file should be equal.  If I put yourform.xfdl and yourform_reencoded.xfdl into beyond compare, however, they do not match up.  Also, the original file can be viewed in an <a href = "http://www.grants.gov/help/download_software.jsp#pureedge">.xfdl viewer</a>.  The viewer says that the re-encoded xfdl is unreadable.  

I have also tried uuenview to re-encode in base64, it also produces the same results. Any help would be appreciated.##C##<unix><linux><base64><gzip><compression><encryption>##C##@$R$@

When using the java search on one particular project, I get an error message saying 'Class file name must end with .class' (see stack trace below). This does not seem to be happening on all projects, just one particular one, so perhaps there's something I should try to get rebuilt?

I have already tried Project -> Clean... and Closing Eclipse, deleting all the built class files and restarting Eclipse to no avail.

The only reference I've been able to find on Google for the problem is at [http://www.crazysquirrel.com/computing/java/eclipse/error-during-java-search.jspx][1], but unfortunately his solution (closing, deleting class files, restarting) did not work for me.

Also just found this thread - [http://www.myeclipseide.com/PNphpBB2-viewtopic-t-20067.html][2] - which indicates the same problem may occur when the project name contains a period. Unfortunately, that's not the case in my setup, so I'm still stuck.

How does this differ in Performance from the following two:

Putting aside any functional or coding best practice arguments, is there any performance difference between the 3 approaches?

On a few occasions recently, I've wanted to design and code a Form object that I could plug into several other "parent" forms.  My goal is to create a centralized piece of code for managing several UI components in a particular way, and then be able to use that (both the UI layout and the logic) in more than one place.  I'm certainly willing to use code (rather than the Design View) to load the child form.

The best I've come up with so far is to pull all of the interesting logic for the child form into a Class Module, and have each parent form lay out the UI (in a Picture control, perhaps) and pass that Picture object into the class module.  The class then knows how to operate on the picture, and it assumes that all its expected pieces have been laid out appropriately.  This approach has several downsides, and I'd like something a bit more elegant.##C##<vb6><code-reuse>##C##@$R$@

(I don't know my C++ well enough, but is it the case that integral and constant static variables are initialized before any code is executed (ie, even before static constructors are executed - their values may already be "initialized" in the program image)?

Multithreading isn't my forte so I'm wondering if anyone could give me some patterns that I might be able to use to parse the file in an optimal manner.

My first thoughts are to read all the lines into some sort of queue and then spin up threads to pull the lines off the queue and process them, but that means the queue would have to exist in memory and these are faily large files so I'm not so keen on that idea.

My next thoughts are to have some sort of controller that will read in a line and assign it a thread to parse, but I'm not sure if the controller will end up being a bottleneck if the threads are processing the lines faster than it can read and assign them.

I know there's probably another simpler solution than both of these but at the moment I'm just not seeing it.##C##<c#><threading><multithreaded><quadcore>##C##@$R$@

One big problem I had was the problems I encountered when I had to step through it in the debugger.

There's an article on how to debug a SharePoint workflow [here][1] that tells you how to set breakpoints etc. This involves copying the .pdb file into the GAC alongside the .dll file containing your workflow. You have to do this from a command prompt (or a batch file) because Windows Explorer doesn't let you view the relevant subdirectory of c:\windows\assembly.

However, if you do this, the next time you try to deploy the workflow from within Visual Studio, it complains that it can't be deployed because "the file may not be signed" and if you attempt to copy the new version of the dll into the GAC, it tells you that the .dll file is locked.

I've found that some of the time, you can get round this by doing an iisreset, but on other occasions you have to restart Visual Studio and there have been frequent times when I've even had to reboot the computer altogether because some mystery process has locked the file. When I don't use the debugger, on the other hand, everything works just fine.

Does anyone know of a simpler way of debugging workflows than this?

    {
      public NewCombo() { DropDownItems = 50; }
    }

The problem is that the base class property "DropDownItems" has a 'default' attribute set on it that is a different value (not 50).  As a result, when I drag the control onto a form, the designer file gets an explicit 'mycontrol.DropDownItems = 50;' line.

At first this doesn't matter.  But if later I change my inherited class to 'DropDownItems = 45;' in the constructor this does not affect any of the controls on any form since all those designer files still have the value 50 hardcoded in them.  And the whole point was to have the value set in one place so I can deal with the customer changing his mind.

Obviously, if I were creating my own custom property in the subclass, I could give it its own designer default attribute of whatever I wanted.  But here I'm wanting to change the default values of properties in the base.  Is there any way to apply Visual Studio attributes to a base class member?  Or is there some other workaround to get the result I want?

I have a project (I'll call it myproject) that includes another project (vendor).  The vendor project is a standalone project maintained by someone else.  Including a project like this is fairly [straightforward][1], but in this case there is a tiny snag: each project generates its own config.h file, each of which defines standard macros such as PACKAGE, VERSION, etc.  This means that, during the build, when vendor is being built, I get lots of errors like this:

    ... warning: "VERSION" redefined
    ... warning: this is the location of the previous definition
    ... warning: "PACKAGE" redefined
    ... warning: this is the location of the previous definition

These are just warnings, for the time being at least, but I would like to get rid of them.  The only relevant information I've been able to turn up with a google search is [this][2] thread on the automake mailing list, which isn't a whole lot of help.  Does anybody else have any better ideas?

It's usually done at the last minute (or not at all), next to no time gets allocated to it, etc.

In the past I've picked a tool, installed it on my machine first, hit the home page, upping the concurrency settings. Then I'd write a simple login script, a simple site walkthrough (in an ecommerce site adding a few items to a cart and checkout). Then I'd rope in as many developers as I could, install the stress test tool on their machines and do a massive attack. If nothing broke I'd give up and wait for the actual traffic to kill the site for real. 

Just hitting the homepage hard almost always would locate a major problem. More scalability problems would surface at the second stage, and even more - after the launch.

The tools I used were Microsoft Homer (aka <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e2c0585a-062a-439e-a67d-75a89aa36495&displaylang=en">Microsoft Web Application Stress Tool</a>) and <a href="http://www.pylot.org/">Pylot</a>.

The reports that these tools generated never made much sense to me, and I spent many hours trying to figure out what kind of concurrent load the site would be able to support. It was always worth it because the stupidest bugs and bottlenecks would always come up (like web server misconfigurations, for instance).

I'm looking for tutorials or something that provide a fairly gentle introduction to the subject, though I don't mind if it assumes basic knowledge of web services and SOAP. Most of the stuff I've seen so far is very technical and you need a lot of complex, detailed background knowledge to understand it properly.

For instance; I have a I/O Completion Port class that throws in the constructor if it can't initialise the port correctly. This uses the Win32 function of CreateIoCompletionPort in the initialiser list. If the handle isn't set correctly - a non-null value - then the constructor will throw an exception. I have never seen this function fail.

I am pretty certain that this (and other functions like it in my code) if they fail will behave correctly, the code is 50 lines long including white-space, so my questions are a) is it worth testing that it will throw, b) and if it is worth testing, how to?

For b) I thought about overriding CreateIoCompletionPort and passing the values through. In the unit test override it and cause it to return 0 when a certain value is passed in. However since this is used in the constructor then this needs to be static. Does this seem valid or not?

I want to redirect this to an alternative place within the same process.  On unix I have done this with a socketpair and a thread: one end of the socket is where I send stderr (via a call to dup2) and the other end is monitored in a thread, where I can then process the output.

This does not work on windows though because a socket is not the same as a thread.

All documents I have found on the web show how to redirect output from a child process, which is not what I want.  How can I redirect stderr within the same process getting a callback of some sort when output is written?

In my case, I want to verify that an XML structure is serialized to a byte array with the UTF-8 encoding which is of variable character length. As an example, my current ugly procedure is to inject a character known to require two bytes into the structure before serializing, then replacing the two-byte character with an ASCII character and comparing the serialized array lengths. This should yield two serialized arrays where the array containing the two-byte characters should have length +1.

Plus if the solution is elegant for Java. 
I can't think of any elegant way to seek for a byte sequence in a byte array. (Could be used to seek for a known byte sequence representing the desired character representation in UTF-8.)##C##<java><xml><string><serialization><encoding>##C##@$R$@

That's because the select element is considered an ActiveX object and is on top of every HTML element in the page.

I already saw people hiding selects when opening a popup div, that leads to pretty bad user experience having controls disappearing.

FogBugz actually had a pretty smart solution (before v6) of turning every select into text boxes when a popup was displayed. This solved the bug and tricked the user eye but the behavior was not perfect.

Another solution is in FogBugz 6 where they no more use the select element and recoded it everywhere.

Last solution I currently use is messing up the IE rendering engine and force it to render the absolutely positioned div as an ActiveX element too, ensuring it can live over a select element. This is achieved by placing an invisible iframe inside the div and styling it with:

    #MyDiv iframe
    {
     position: absolute;
     z-index: -1;
     filter: mask();
     border: 0;

Technology of choice is C# windows service.  The output could be called a report, I suppose, but a reporting engine is not necessary.  A simple templating engine, like StringTemplate, or even XSLT outputting HTML would be fine.  The problem I'm having is finding a free way to print this kind of output from a service.  Since it *seems* that it will work, I'm working on a prototype using Microsoft's RDLC, populating a local report and then rendering it as an image to a memory stream, which I will then print.  Issues with that are:

  - Multi-page printing will be a big headache.
  - Still have to use PrintDocument to print the memory stream, which is unsupported in a Windows Service (though it may work - haven't gotten that far with the prototype yet)
  - If the data coming across changes, I have to change the dataset, and the class that the data is being deserialized into.  bad bad bad.

Has anyone had to do anything remotely like this?  Any advice?  I already posed a question about printing HTML without user input, and after wasting about 3 days on that, I have come to the conclusion that it cannot be done, at least not with any freely available tool.

The problem is that I can't seem to get it centered properly.  No matter what I set for the Y coordinate of the location of the string render, it always comes out lower than that and the larger the text size the greater the Y offset.  For example, at text size 12, the offset is about 4, but at 32 the offset is about 10.  I want the character to vertically take up most of the rectangle it's being drawn in and be centered horizontally. Here's my basic code.  "this" is referencing the user control it's being drawn in.

For instance in .Net 2.0

    public interface IHaveChildren {
        string ParentType { get; }
        int ParentId { get; }
    
        List<IChild> GetChildren()
    }

Can (in 3.5) become:

    public interface IHaveChildren {
        string ParentType { get; }
        int ParentId { get; }
    }

    public static HaveChildrenExtension {
        public static List<IChild> GetChildren( this IHaveChildren ) {
            //logic to get children by parent type and id
            //shared for all classes implementing IHaveChildren 
        }
    }

This seems to me to be a better mechanism for many interfaces.  They no longer need an abstract base to share this code, and functionally the code works the same. This could make code more maintainable and easier to test.

The only disadvantage being that an abstract bases implementation can be virtual, but can that be worked around (would an instance method hide an extension method with the same name? would it be confusing code to do so?)

I'm using Pylons (a python framework) to serve a simple web application, but it seems to die from time to time, with this in the error log: (2006, 'MySQL server has gone away')

I did a bit of checking, and saw that this was because the connections to MySQL were not being renewed. This shouldn't be a problem though, because the sqlalchemy.pool_recycle in the config file should automatically keep it alive. The default was 3600, but I dialed it back to 1800 because of this problem. It helped a bit, but 3600 *should* be fine according to the docs. The errors still happen semi-regularly. I don't want to lower it too much though and DOS my own database :).

Maybe something in my MySQL config is goofy? Not sure where to look exactly.

The main problem is that all the tools I've been trying like [EMS Data Import][1] and [Firebird Data Wizard][2] expect that my csv file contains all the information needed by my Table.

I need to write some custom SQL in the insert statement, for example, I have a cvs file with the city name, but as my database already has all the cities in another table (normalized), I need to write a subselect in the insert statement to lookup for the city and write its ID, also I have a stored procedure to cread GUIDS.

My Insert statement would be something like this:

  INSERT INTO PERSON (ID, NAME, CITY_ID) VALUES((SELECT NEW_GUID FROM CREATE_GUID), :NAME, (SELECT CITY_ID FROM CITY WHERE NAME = :CITY_NAME)

I know that it is very easy to write an application to do this, but I don't like to reinvent the wheel, and I'm sure that there are some tools out there to do it.

Can you guys give me some advice?

In the past I've read that people have instrumented their user interfaces, but what I haven't found is examples or tips on *how* to instrument a UI.

  - How are you instrumenting your UI?
  - What format are you storing the instrumentation?
  - How are you processing the instrumented data?
  - How are you keeping your UI code clean with this instrumentation logic?

Specifically, I am implementing my UI in WPF, so this will provide extra challenges compared to instrumenting a web-based application. (i.e. need to transfer the instrumented data back to a central location, etc). That said, I feel the technology may provide an easier implementation of instrumentation via concepts like attached properties.

Previously we were running this entire test suite on one machine, which took about 24-72 hours to complete the entire test run. We now have created our own system for grouping and distributing the tests among about three separate machines and the tests are prioritized so that the core tests get run first for more immediate results and the extra tests run when there is an available machine.

I am curious if anyone has found a good way to distribute their tests among several machines to reduce total test time for a complete run and what tools were used to achieve that. I've done some research and it looks like TestNG is [moving in this direction][1], but it looks like it is still under quite a bit of development. 

We don't plan on rewriting any of our tests, but as we add new tests and test new products or add-ons I'd like to be able to deal with the fact that we are working with very large numbers of tests. On the other hand, if we can find a tool that would help distribute our Junit 3.x tests even in a very basic fashion, that *would* be helpful since we wouldn't have to maintain our own tooling to do that.

You want to check for a certain object in the collection, but the collection doesn't have a Contains() method.  There are several ways of dealing with this.

  - Implement your own Contains() method by looping through all items in the collection to see if one of them is what you are looking for. This seems to be the "best practice" approach.
  - I recently came across some code where instead of a loop, there was an attempt to access the object inside a try statement, as follows:

I'm trying to bridge backups generated by [webmin][1] with the upload tool available inside [mysql administrator][2]. My data already has a couple of inconsistencies (ticks, commas, etc, I think) I just wont try to kink out (they might just reappear in the future anyways). These kinks generate errors when I try to restore out of my backups.

Now, if I generate backups from webmin, and then use MySQL administrator to restore them, they fail. But if I generate the backups using MySQL Administrator AND tick "Compatibility Mode", then head over to MySQL administrator (another instance) and restore... it works! 

According to MySQL, "Compatibility Mode" is;
> Compatibility mode creates backup files that are compatible with older versions of MySQL Administrator. 

Webmin, on the other hand, gives me the following options for compatibility:

- ANSI
- MySQL 3.2.3
- MySQL 4.0
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL
- DB2
- MaxDB

Which would you say is a best fit? My data set is very large, so it would take quite some time to experiment one by one (specially whence thinking might beat brute-forcing it).

I have a server on https for which I paid an SSL cert for and a mirror for which I haven't and keep around for just for emergencies so it doesn't merit getting a cert for.

On my client's desktops I have SOME shortcuts which point to http://production_server and https://production_server (both work), however; I know that if my prod. server goes down, then DNS forwarding kicks in and those clients which have https on their shortcut will be staring at https://mirror_server (Which doesnt work) and a big fat IE7 red screen of uneasyness for my company. 

Unfortunately, I can't just switch this around at the client level. These users are very computer illiterate: and are very likely to freak out from seeing https "insecurity" errors (specially the way FFX3 and IE7 handle it nowadays: FULL STOP, kinda thankfully, but not helping me here LOL).

The advantage of this approach is that, **for most people, the CAPTCHA won't ever be visible!**

However, for people with JavaScript disabled, we still need a fallback -- and this is where it gets tricky.

I have written a [traditional CAPTCHA control for ASP.NET](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/custom-controls/CaptchaControl.aspx) which we can re-use.

<img src="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/custom-controls/CaptchaControl/CaptchaImage-medium.jpg"/>

However, I'd prefer to go with something textual to avoid the overhead of creating all these images on the server with each request.

I've seen things like..

- ASCII text captcha: `\/\/(_)\/\/`
- math puzzles: what is 7 minus 3 times 2?
- trivia questions: what tastes better, a toad or a popsicle?

Maybe I'm just tilting at windmills here, but I'd like to have a less resource intensive, non-image based `<noscript>` compatible CAPTCHA if possible.

For example, I have a route like this:

    <% using (Html.Form("TestController", "TestAction", FormMethod.Get))
       { %>
         <input type="text" name="paramName" />

which renders to:

    <form method="get" action="/TestController.mvc/TestAction">
      <input type="text" name="paramName" />
      <input type="submit" />
    </form>


The resulting URL of a form submission is:

**localhost/TestController.mvc/TestAction?paramName=value**

Ideally, I'd like extra items added to the TortoiseSVN context menu - "Shelve" & "Unshelve".
"Shelve" would remove the current shelve-set, and upload the working directory under a suitable path defined by user options. "Unshelve" would merge the set with the working copy.

But when i set the configuration of the workspace to "RELEASE" mdoe, and repeat the process, the encoder crashes at some test case run.

Ideally, what I would like is to be able to add _typed_ properties, so that the "value" returned is always of the type that I want it to be.  

The type should always be a primitive. This class subclasses an abstract class which basically stores the name and value as string. The idea being that this subclass will add some type-safety to the base class (as well as saving me on some conversion).

So, I have created a class which is (roughly) this:

    public class Property<DataType> : Property
    {
     public DataType TypedValue
     {
       get { // Having problems here! }
       set { base.Value = value.ToString();}
     }
    }

So the question is:

**Is there a "generic" way to convert from string back to a primitive?**  

I can't seem to find any generic interface that links the conversion across the board (something like _ITryParsable_ would have been ideal!).##C##<c#><generics><primitives><type-safety>##C##@$R$@

Is it simply a case of including a timer across each database call and logging the result, or is there a 'neater' way of doing it?  Maybe there's a framework that does this for you already, or is there a flag I could enable in e.g. Linq-to-SQL that would provide similar functionality.

One of the issues I'm running into is getting the timer to "tick" accurately enough.

For example, assuming an easy BPM (beats per minute) of 120, the timer should tick every .5 seconds (or 500 milliseconds).  Using this as the basis for the ticks, however, isn't entirely accurate as .NET only guarantees that your timer will not tick before the elapsed time has passed.

Currently, to get around this for the same 120 BPM example used above, I am setting the ticks to something like 100 milliseconds and only playing the click sound on every 5th timer tick.  This does improve the accuracy quite a bit, but if feels like a bit of a hack.

So, what is the best way to get accurate ticks?  I know there are more timers available than the windows forms timer that is readily available in Visual Studio, but I'm not really familiar with them.##C##<.net><timer>##C##@$R$@

The processing almost always involves an XML stage and can include a lot of text parsing, database lookups, data conversion and data validation.

Currently the programs performing all these tasks are written in C++ and they perform quite quickly all on one average server. I'm investigating the possibilities of using a more "modern" language that newer graduate programmers are more likely to be familiar with.

Based on the brief information provided, would a language such as python provide the required functionality and performance, as well as addressing the memory allocation (and various other C++ related) problems which arise?

I like the idea of not needing to compile the programs each time we make a change. I understand that the interpreted languages probably wont hit the same performance we currently get.

I've looked at templates like the one [Joe Hewitt](http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/07/meet-joe-hewitt.html) has made, and also seen some templates I can purchase, which I haven't done yet.

I figured someone else had already started on this track and decided that I could probably leech on their newfound knowledge :)

So, does anyone have any pointers? I'm well aware of the problem that the more such a template/framework makes a web app look like a native iPhone app, the more likely I'm going to get into trouble because it just isn't, but for now I want a framework I can start building on, and then in the process figure out how to make it distinctive enough to be perceived as a web app as well as looking like a native iPhone application.

Specifically I'm looking for features like:

* stylesheets set up, or pointers to how to do them for iPhone
* page flipping animation, ie. pick an item in a list, list scrolls out of view to the left and information for item scrolls in from the right
* the animation part would have to work with dynamic pages, ie. not just one big page that has divs set up for each sub-item, which at least one such framework had as a sort of quick fix, I would need to have list item picking load the *page* for that item, and then when loaded, scroll to it

What im trying to do have my build script run the utils build script so that I can ensure the utils jar is up to date.

So I know I need to import the utils build file.

    <import file="../utils/build/build.xml" />

Which doesn't work because the import task, unlike almost every other ant taks, doesn't run from basedir, it runs from the pwd.  So to get around that I have this little ditty, which does successfully import the build file

      <property name="baseDirUpOne" location=".." />
      <import file="${baseDirUpOne}/utils/build/build.xml" />

So now that ive solved my import problem I need to call the task, well that should be easy right:

    <antcall target="utils.package" />

*note that in the above, utils is the project name of ../utils/build/build.xml*

the problem I'm now running into is that ant call doesn't execute in ../utils/build so what I need, and cant find, is a runat property or something similar, essentially:

    <antcall target="utils.package" runat="../utils/build" />

So far, I've tried a number of options and found a [bit][4] of [help][6] related to getting this up on a 32bit machine (and succeeded I might add), but since the original [Windows port][5] is Win32 specific, this is hardly going to help when installing as a service on x64. It also has a dependency on the [libevent][7] for which I can only get a Win32 compiled version.

I have a flash applet that needs to maintain a TCP connection to a server. I have implemented timeouts using Timers, a ping-pong system, etc. However, there's a problem. Upon calling Socket.connect(), the flash player (9.0.115 and many other stables before that) sends 3 connection requests by way of SYN packets, with some time in between. If none of those are replied to (e.g. because the server is down), I cannot get the applet to [attempt to] connect to the server. Ever. That is, within the lifetime of the applet.

To clarify and/or summarize:

For any host/port pair given to Socket.connect() or XMLSocket.connect(), if the call fails, any subsequent connect() calls to any other Socket (or XMLSocket) instances **within the lifetime of the Flash applet** to the same host/port pair get ignored. (At least as far as I can tell using a packet sniffer.)

I have tried calling numerous Socket methods, destroying¹ and recreating the objects, using a pool of Sockets, and various other methods I can't remember right now; all to no avail.

My current solution is to notify the parent webpage through a JavaScript call and let it reload my applet. It's not a pretty solution, and I'm not about to implement workarounds for the problems *it* causes, just because Flash can't handle socket connections properly.

I must be missing something very simple.

    as being used by the Linux OS 
  - 2nd NIC being used by only 1 image and to be unused by the Linux OS (as its part of a DMZ)

Although the second NIC won't be used by Linux, it is certainly recognised as a NIC (e.g. eth1).

Is this possible under VMWare Server, and if so, is it as simple as not binding eth1 under Linux and then bridging it to the image under VMWare Server?

Following on from my [previous question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8625/generic-type-conversion-from-string) on Converting to a Generic Type from String, I thought I would ask another Generics-related question!

This time, **is there a way to enforce/limit the types that are passed to PRIMITIVE's?** _(bool, int, string, etc)_

Now, I know you can limit the generic type parameter to a type or interface implementation via the _where_ clause, however, this doesn't fit the bill for primitives (AFAIK) because the do not all have common ground (apart from _object_ before someone says! :P).

So, my current thoughts are to just grit my teeth and do a big _switch_ statement and throw an _ArgumentException_ on failure..

Now it doesn't, but the compiler won't let me build the project without the assembly reference in place. Let me elaborate.

This project used to throw and catch a custom exception class - the *SuperException* - which was derived from the standard System.Exception and lived in a separate, precompiled assembly, *SuperAssembly.DLL*, which I referenced.

Eventually, I decided this was a pointless exercise and replaced all *SuperExceptions* with a System.SuitableStandardException in each case. I removed the reference to *SuperException.DLL*, but am now met with the following on trying to compile the project:

    The type 'SuperException' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'SuperException, Version=1.1.0.0 (...)'

The source file referenced by the error doesn't seem relevant; it's the project namespace that gets highlighted in the IDE.

Now, here's the thing:

1. All uses of *SuperException* have been eliminated from the project's code.
2. Compared to another project that compiles fine without a reference to *SuperException.DLL*, I only reference one more assembly - and *that* references nothing that my project doesn't reference itself. While it's possible that any of these dependencies could throw *SuperExceptions*, I'm only catching the base Exception class and in any case... the other project builds fine!
3. I've done Visual Studio's "Clean Solution" and cleared everything out by hand, many times.

It's not the end of the world to include this reference, I just don't see why it's necessary any more. Nrrrgg. Any pointers welcome!##C##<c#><.net><dependencies>##C##@$R$@

We have two large files which we'd like to read from two separate threads concurrently.  One thread will sequentially read fileA while the other thread will sequentially read fileB.  There is no locking or communication between the threads, both are sequentially reading as fast as they can, and both are immediately discarding the data they read.

Our experience with this setup on Windows is very poor.  The combined throughput of the two threads is in the order of 2-3 MiB/sec.  The drive seems to be spending most of its time seeking backwards and forwards between the two files, presumably reading very little after each seek.

If we disable one of the threads and temporarily look at the performance of a single thread then we get much better bandwidth (~45 MiB/sec for this machine).  So clearly the bad two-thread performance is an artefact of the OS disk scheduler.

**Is there anything we can do to improve the concurrent thread read performance?**  Perhaps by using different APIs or by tweaking the OS disk scheduler parameters in some way.

Some details:

The files are in the order of 2 GiB each on a machine with 2GiB of RAM.  For the purpose of this question we consider them not to be cached and perfectly defragmented.  We have used defrag tools and rebooted to ensure this is the case.

We are using no special APIs to read these files.  The behaviour is repeatable across various bog-standard APIs such as Win32's CreateFile, C's fopen, C++'s std::ifstream, Java's FileInputStream, etc.

Each thread spins in a loop making calls to the read function.  We have varied the number of bytes requested from the API each iteration from values between 1KiB up to 128MiB.  Varying this has had no effect, so clearly the amount the OS is physically reading after each disk seek is not dictated by this number.  This is exactly what should be expected.

The dramatic difference between one-thread and two-thread performance is repeatable across Windows 2000, Windows XP (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows Server 2003, and also with and without hardware RAID5.##C##<windows><multithreading><file-io>##C##@$R$@

Visual studio’s debugger is great, but it allows you to debug on either HLL code level or asselbly language, you can’t debug IL.
It seems that in some situations it would be useful to have an opportunity to debug at IL level. 

In particular it might be helpful when debugging a problem in the code that you don't have the source of.

It is arguable if it is actually useful to debug IL when you don't have the source, but anyway.

The interface to the business logic layer guarantees safe usage of the business logic, so all the methods and accessors you call will validate input. 

This great when you write the UI code, because you have a neatly defined interface that you can trust.

But here comes the tricky part, when you start writing the data access layer, the interface to the business logic does not accomodate your needs. You need to have more accessors and getters to set fields which are used to be hidden. Now you are forced to erode the interface of your business logic. Now it is possible set fields from the UI layer which the UI layer has no business setting. 

Because of the changes needed for the data access layer, the interface to the business logic has eroded to the point where it is possible to even set the business logic with invalid data. Thus, the interface does not guarantee safe usage anymore.

I hope I explained the problem clearly enough. How do you prevent interface eroding, maintain information hiding and encapsulation and still accomodate different interface needs among different layers? ##C##<architecture>##C##@$R$@

Now, with .net 3.0, we got auto-properties:

    public string Title { get; set; }

I know this is more a philosophical/subjective questions, but is there any reason to use these auto-properties except from saving 5 lines of code for each field? My personal gripe is that those properties are hiding stuff from me, and I am not a big fan of black magic.

In fact, the hidden private field does not even show up in the Debugger, which is OK given the fact that the get/set functions do nothing. But when I want to actually implement some getter/setter logic, I have to use the private/public pair anyway.

I see the benefit that I save a lot of code (1 vs 6 lines) without losing the ability to change the getter/setter logic later, but then again I can already do that by simply declaring a public field "Public string Title" without the need of the { get; set; } block, thus even saving more code.

So, what am I missing here? Why would anyone actually want to use auto-properties?##C##<c#><.net>##C##@$R$@

Unfortunately this seems to break the Visual Studio Forms Designer, in both VS2005 and 2008.

and is instantiated in the `InitializeComponent` method as follows:

As mentioned earlier, the program compiles and runs perfectly, and I've tried shifting the `SortableListView` class out to a seperate assembly so it can be compiled seperately, but this makes no difference.

I have two drop down controls, on the first drop down I have a javascript onChange event. The javascript enables the second drop down and removes a value from it (the value selected in the first drop down). If they click the blank first value of the dropdown, then the second drop down will be disabled (and the options reset).

I also have code in the OnPreRender method that will enable or disable the second drop down based on the value of the first drop down. This is so that the value of the first drop down can be selected in code (loading user settings).

My problem is:
  

 1. The user selects something in the first drop down. The second drop down will become enabled through javascript. 
 2. They then change a third drop down that initiates a post back. After the post back the drop downs are in the correct state (first value selected, second drop down enabled).
 3. If they then click the back button, the second drop down will no longer be enabled although it should be since there's something selected in the first drop down.

I've tried adding a startup script (that will set the correct state of the second drop down) through ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript, however when this gets called the first drop down has a selectedIndex of 0, not what it actually is. My guess is that the value of the selection gets set after my start script (but still doesn't call the onChange script).

The way I figure, there's 2 ways I can think of:

1."Use the **Source**, Luke"  
In the code where I'm calling DataGrid.DataBind(), use the DataTable.Compute() method (*or in my case DataSet.DataTable(0).Compute()*). For example:  

    Dim strAverage = DataTable.Compute("Avg(ColumnName)", "")  
But once I have this, how can I insert it into the footer?
  
2."**Bound** for Glory"  
Using the DataGrid.ItemDataBound event, and calculating a running total from every ListItemType.Item and ListItemType.AlternatingItem, finally displaying in ListItemType.Footer. For example:  

    Select Case e.Item.ItemType
        Case ListItemType.Item, ListItemType.AlternatingItem
            runningTotal += CInt(e.Item.Cells(2).Text)
        Case ListItemType.Footer
            e.Item.Cells(2).Text = runningTotal/DataGrid.Items.Count
    End Select
This just feels wrong, plus I would have to make sure the runningTotal is reset on every DataBind.

The background is that we have a windows service (.NET 2.0 exe) that dynamically loads assemblies (almost like plug-ins) to complete various work items asked of it. Whenever we roll out a new version of the bus logic, we just drop the assemblies on an FTP server and the windows service knows how to check for, grab and store the latest versions.

There is a W3C recommendation for SVG though this format is still not recognized by Internet Explorer support of which is a must (for a public website). IE handles VML though and there are even javascript libraries that do some canvas-like drawing depending on a browser (SVG vs. VML) - [excanvas][1], [GFX of Dojo Toolkit][2] and more. That would be nice and acceptable though none of them can display an SVG image from the given markup.

So the question actually consists of several parts:

 1. Are there any cross-browser Javascript libraries that display vector graphics from given markup (not obligatory SVG) and offer availability to attach to DOM events?
 2. If there are not, which of the most pupular browser-embedded technologies would be most suitable for doing such a task? I can choose from Flex/Flash, Java applet. Silverlight is not an option because of Windows lock-in.

On a machine there is a Fritz ISDN card. There is a process that is responsible for playing a certain wave file on this device's wave out (ISDN connection is made at startup and made persistent). The scenario is easy, whenever needed the process calls waveOutWrite() on the previously opened wave device (everything initialized without any problems of course) and a callback function waits for MM_WOM_DONE msg to know that the playback has been finished. 

Since a few days however (nothing changed neither in the process nor the machine) the MM_WOM_DONE message comes immediately after calling waveOutWrite() even though the wave lasts a couple of seconds. Again no error is reported, it looks like the file was played but had zero length (which is not the case). I am also sure that waveOutReset() was not called by my process (it would also trigger sending the mentioned message). I already used to have some strange problems in the past that where solved simply by reinstalling TAPI drivers. This time for some reason it is problematic form me to perform that once again and am trying more analytical approach :). Any suggestions what might cause such a behavior? Maybe sth on the other end of ISDN line?##C##<c++><windows><waveout>##C##@$R$@

Currently, if two users open the same document, modify it and save the changes, document's state will be undefined (either the first user's changes are saved permanently, or the second's). This is entirely unsatisfactory. I considered two possibilities to solve this problem.

The first is to lock document when it is opened by someone the first time, and unlock it when it is closed. But if network connection to the server is suddenly interrupted, the document would stay in forever-locked state. The obvious solution is to send regular pings to the server. If server doesn't receive K pings in a row (K > 1) from a particular client, documents locked by this client are unlocked. If that client re-appears, documents are locked again, if someone hadn't already locked them. This could also help if the client application (running in web browser) is terminated unexpectedly, making it impossible to send 'quitting, unlock my documents' signal to the server.

The second is to store multiple versions of the same document saved by different users. If changes to the document are made in a rapid succession, system would offer either to merge versions or to select preferred version. To optimize storage space, only document diffs should be kept. (Just like source control software).

What method should I choose, taking into consideration that the connection to the server might *sometimes* be slow and unresponsive? How should the parameters (ping interval, rapid succession interval) be determined?

P.S. Unfortunately, I can't store the documents in a database.##C##<versioning><document-server><locking><concurrent>##C##@$R$@

I have no control over the legacy (and poorly designed) database table structure.

Consider a scenario similar to a resume search where a user may want to perform a search against any of the data in the resume and get back a list of resumes that match their search criteria.  Any field can be searched at anytime and in combination with one or more other fields.

The actual sql query gets created dynamically depending on which fields are searched.  Most solutions I've found involve complicated if blocks, but I can't help but think there must be a more elegant solution since this must be a solved problem by now.##C##<sql><search><dynamicsql><pattern>##C##@$R$@

A point which has been brought up recurrently, is that of dealing with system vs. user values; in our project user and system vals are stored together. For example...

We have a list of templates.

    1, <system template>
    
    2, <system template>
    
    3, <system template>


These are mapped in the app to an enum (1, 2, 3)

Then a user comes in and adds...

    4, <user template>

...And... 

    5, <user template>

Then.. we issue an upgrade.. and insert as part of our upgrade scripts...

    <new id> [6], <new system template>

THEN!!... we find a bug in the new system template and need to update it... The problem is how? We cannot update record using ID6 (as we may have inserted it as 9, or 999, so we have to identify the record using some other mechanism)

So, we've come to two possible solutions for this.

**In the red corner (speed)....**
---------------------------------

We simply start user Ids at 5000 (or some other value) and test data at 10000 (or some other value). This would allow us to make modifications to system values and test them up to the lower limit of the next ID range. 

Advantage...Quick and easy to implement, 

Disadvantage... could run out of values if we don't choose a big enough range!


**In the blue corner (scalability)...**
---------------------------------------

We store, system and user data separately, use GUIDs as Ids and merge the two lists using a view.

Advantage...Scalable..No limits w/regard to DB size. 

Disadvantage.. More complicated to implement. (many to one updatable views etc.)


----------


I plump squarely for the first option, but looking for some ammo to back me up!

Does anyone have any thoughts on these approaches, or even one(s) that we've missed?

Thanks,

The events for the .drag elements are working.

I was wondering if there was a more developer friendly ERP out there. I have looked into Microsoft Dynamics but getting information on ERP systems that isn't a bunch of business jargon is next to impossible.

I will be using C# 3.whatever and .NET MVC.##C##<c#><erp>##C##@$R$@

I've been tasked with updating a series of applications which are performance critical VB.NET apps that essentially just monitor and return networking statistics. I've only got three requirements: *convert it to C#, make it fast, and make it stable*

One caveat is that we *"may"* migrate from a .NET platform to linux *"soon"*

I will be responsible for maintaining these apps in the future so I'd like to do this right. I have decided to refactor these apps according to the MVP pattern so that I can properly unit test the hell out of this bad boy. But I was also thinking since I was using MVP that I could also do the computationally expensive stuff in native C/C++ code while the GUI would be done with .NET forms, or Qt or whatever.

questions: 

1) does it make sense to do a GUI in winforms but the expensive stuff in native, unmanaged C/C++ ?

2) any recommendations for a good cross platform windowing kit that would fit for the scenario described above?

My plan is to include content such as my resume, any projects that I have done on my own and links to open source projects that I have contributed to, and so on. However, I'm not sure which approach would be better from a perspective of "advertising" myself, since that what this site does, especially since I am a software developer.

Should I use an out-of-the-box system and extend it as needed, with available modules and custom modules where needed or should I custom build a site and all of its features as I need them? Does a custom site look better in the eyes of a potential employer who might visit my site?##C##<website><content-management-system><personal-website>##C##@$R$@

It uses many, many threads, but with no apparent design or common architectural principles.  Every developer had his own style of multithreaded programming, so some threads communicate with one another using queues, some lock data with mutexes, some lock with semaphores, some use operating-system IPC mechanisms for intra-process communications.  There is no design documentation, and comments are sparse.  It's a mess, and it seems that whenever we try to refactor the code or add new functionality, we introduce deadlocks or other problems.

So, does anyone know of any tools or techniques that would help to analyze and document all the interactions between threads?  FWIW, the codebase is C++ on Linux, but I'd be interested to hear about tools for other environments.##C##<threads><multithreaded><threading><softwaretools>##C##@$R$@

The custom list defines an iterator;

    class Iterator: public std::iterator<std::forward_iterator_tag, T> {
        // ...
    }

    Iterator begin() {
        return (Iterator(root));
    }

    Iterator end() {
        return (Iterator(NULL));

with the appropriate operators overloaded. 

Ideally, I would like to do this;

    class Foo {
    public:
        Foo() {
            std::list<int> x;
            std::vector<int> y;
            custom_list<int> z;

            iter = x.begin(); // OR

            // ...
        };
    private:
        std::iterator<int> iter;
    };

But obviously these are all iterators of different types. I can assume all the containers are of the same type however.

The problem is that you have one of your pages in a web application timing out when it gets to a stored procedure call, so you use Sql Profiler, or your application trace logs, to find the query and you paste it into management studio to figure our why it's running slow.  But you run it from there and it just blazes along, returning in less than a second each time.

Well, I can only presume this as the numbers listed in the profiler are way short of the maximum allowed (32mb on CE 5). Profiling a particular app with the RPM showed me that the total usage of all the caches only manages to get to about 12mb and then slowly shrinks as (I assume) something unmanaged starts to claim more memory.
The memory slider in System also shows that the device is very short on memory. If I kill the process the slider shows all the memory coming back. So it must (?) be this managed process that is swallowing the memory.

Is there any simple(ish?) fashion how one can track unmanaged memory usage in some way that might enable me to match it up with the corresponding P/Invoke calls?

What sent me down this road of research was trying to publish files to a WSS 3.0 document library from a user's machine. I can't map a drive to the library in question because the WSS site is only available to authenticate via NTLM on a port other than 80 or 443. I suppose I could alternately use the WSS web services to push the files out, but I'm really curious about the answer to this question now.##C##<sharepoint><command-line><scripting><powershell><moss><wss>##C##@$R$@

My personal preference would be to utilize a prefix for instance variables both for clarity within functions and to prevent shadowing of function parameters. However I'm a fan of properties which rules out prefixes (unless you also prefix your property names, which doesn't work too well and looks daft). Similarly I could use the "self.variable" convention, but only if I make EVERYTHING a property.

So given the code below what's your preferred naming style for instance/function variables? And if you don't bother, how do you deal with shadowing on function params?

What the author doesn't mention, though, is that `StringIO` is just an "I."  There's no "O."  You _can't_ do this, for example:

    s = StringIO.new
    s << 'foo'
    s << 'bar'
    s.tos         # I mean with an underscore, but Markdown hates that
    # => should be "foo\nbar"
    # => really is ''`

Ruby really needs a StringBuffer just like the one Java has. StringBuffers serve two important purposes. First, they let you test the output half of what Ruby's StringIO does. Second, they are useful for building up long strings from small parts -- something that Joel reminds us over and over again is otherwise very very slow.

Is there a good replacement?

I've tried adding alerts before and after the call, and they show that the display has changed from "none" to "block" but the div does not display.

I can get the div to display in FF3 if I change the display value using Firebug's HTML inspector (but not by running javascript through Firebug's console) - so I know it's not just showing up off screen, etc.

So, after googling for the answer and finding only a little bit of information on it I came up with the following and decided to post it here now that I'm in the beta.

The 'click sound' in question is actually a system wide preference, so I only want it to be disabled when my application has focus and then re-enable when the application closes/loses focus.

                    return String.IsNullOrEmpty(keyValue) == false && keyValue != "\"\"";
                }
                set
                {
                    string keyValue;

                    if (value)

                        keyValue = "%SystemRoot%\\Media\\";
                        if (Environment.OSVersion.Version.Major == 5 && Environment.OSVersion.Version.Minor > 0)

                            keyValue += "Windows XP Start.wav";
                        }
                        else if (Environment.OSVersion.Version.Major == 6)

                            keyValue += "Windows Navigation Start.wav";
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            // Don't know the file name so I won't be able to re-enable it
                            return;
                        }
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        keyValue = "\"\"";
                    }

                    // Open and set the key that points to the file
                    RegistryKey key = Registry.CurrentUser.OpenSubKey(@"AppEvents\Schemes\Apps\Explorer\Navigating\.Current", true);
                    key.SetValue(null, keyValue,  RegistryValueKind.ExpandString);
                    isEnabled = value;
                }
            }
        }
    }

Then in the main form we use the above code in these 3 events:  

* Activated  
* Deactivated  
* FormClosing

        private void Form1_Activated(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Disable the sound when the program has focus
            WebClickSound.Enabled = false;
        }

        private void Form1_Deactivate(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Enable the sound when the program is out of focus
            WebClickSound.Enabled = true;
        }
        
        private void Form1_FormClosing(object sender, FormClosingEventArgs e)
        {
            // Enable the sound on app exit
            WebClickSound.Enabled = true;
        }


The one problem I see currently is if the program crashes they won't have the click sound until they re-launch my application, but they wouldn't know to do that.

My DBUnit tests are highly customized, but I don't think it is the issue.  When I run the tests, I get a failure SQLCODE: -1084, SQLSTATE: 57019, [which translates to][1] "SQL1084C Shared memory segments cannot be allocated."

It sounds like a weird memory issue, though here's the big strange thing.  If I ssh to the test database server, then go in to db2 and do "connect to MY_DB", the tests start succeeding!  This seems to have no relation to the supposed memory error that is being reported.

I have 2 tests, and the first one actually succeeds, the second one is the one that fails.  However, it fails in the DBUnit setup code, when it is obtaining the connection to the DB server to load my xml dataset.

Any ideas what might be going on?

    "x=1 and y=abc and z=c4g and ..."

Some attributes have numeric values, some have alpha values, some have mixed, some have dates, etc.

Every string is *supposed* to have "`x=someval and y=anotherval`" at the beginning, but some don't.  I have three things I need to do.  

1. Validate the strings to be certain that they have `x` and `y`.  
2. Actually parse the values for `x` and `y`.
3. Get the rest of the string.

Given the example at the top, this would result in the following variables:

    $x = 1;
    $y = "abc";
    $remainder = "z=c4g and ..."

My question is: Is there a (reasonably) simple way to parse these *and* validate with a single regular expression?  i.e.:

    if ($str =~ /someexpression/)
    {
        $x = $1;
        $y = $2;
        $remainder = $3;
    }

Note that the string may consist of *only* `x` and `y` attributes.  This is a valid string.

Unfortunately, that doesn't look to be so simple - The writer has no way to take an event type and a parser object, only methods like writeAttribute and writeStartElement.

Currently, the clients remoting call RemotingService and blocks while the RemotingService call is serviced. However, the remoting service is getting complicated enough (with more RPC calls and complex algorithms) that the asp.net worker threads are blocked for a significantly long time (4-5 seconds).

According to [this msdn article][1], doing this will not scale well because an asp.net worker thread is blocked for each remoting RPC. It advises switching to async handlers to free up asp.net worker threads.

This seems fine, except the remoting call still takes up a thread from the thread pool.
Is this the same thread pool as the asp.net worker threads? 

**How should I go about turning my remoting singleton server into an async system such that I free up my asp.net worker threads?**

Then, I begin writing my Sentence class, and when it needs to interact with the Word class, I will often write my unit tests such that they test both Sentence and Word... at least in the places where they interact.

Have these tests essentially become integration tests because they now test the integration of these 2 classes?  Or is it just a unit test that spans 2 classes?

Part of this refactoring, has been to move code that's common to two of my models to a module that I can include where I need it.

So far, so good. Looks like it's going to work out, but I've just hit a problem that I'm not sure how to get around.  The module (which I've called sendable), is just going to be the code that handles faxing, e-mailing, or printing a PDF of the document.  So, for example, I have a purchase order, and I have Internal Sales Orders (imaginatively abbreviated to ISO).

The problem I've struck, is that I want some variables initialised (initialized for people who don't spell correctly :P ) after the object is loaded, so I've been using the **after_initialize** hook. No problem... until I start adding some more mixins.

The problem I have, is that I can have an **`after_initialize`** in any one of my mixins, so I need to include a **super** call at the start to make sure the other mixin **`after_initialize`** calls get called.  Which is great, until I end up calling super and I get an error because there is no super to call.

Here's a little example, in case I haven't been confusing enough:

    class Iso < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Shared::TracksSerialNumberExtension
      include Shared::OrderLines
      extend  Shared::Filtered

One viewpoint is that the data layer should be aware of business objects (our own classes that represent an entity), and be able to work with that object natively.  

The opposing viewpoint is that the data layer should be object-agnostic, and purely handle simple data types (strings, bools, dates, etc.)

I can see that both approaches may be valid, but my own viewpoint is that I prefer the former.  That way, if the data storage medium changes, the business layer doesn't (necessarily) have to change to accommodate the new data layer.  It would therefore be a trivial thing to change from a SQL data store to a serialized xml filesystem store.

My colleague's point of view is that the data layer shouldn't have to know about object definitions, and that as long as the data is passed about appropriately, that is enough.  

Now, I know that this is one of those questions that has the potential to start a religious war, but I'd appreciate any feedback from the community on how you approach such things.

Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(this)</code> (from a <code>DragEvent.DRAG_OVER</code> handler), but if the user then moves out of this area I'd like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the <code>DragManager.NONE</code> feedback. However, neither calling <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(null)</code> nor <code>DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE)</code> seems to have any effect. Once I've accepted the drag an set the feedback type I can't seem to change it.

Just to make it clear: the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field (like the selection). Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but I'd rather not if it isn't necessary.##C##<flex><dragdrop>##C##@$R$@

Our codebase contains ALOT of legacy/archaic code which must be kept operational. Some of this code is older than me (originally written in the late 70s) and some members of our team are still on Visual Studio 6.

However, a conclusion has thankfully been reached internally that our product is looking somewhat antiquated compared to our competitors', and that something needs to be done.

I am currently working on a new area of the UI which is quite separate from the rest of the product. I have therefore been given the chance to try out 'new' technology stacks as a sort of proving ground before the long process of moving over the rest of the UI begins.

I have been using C# with Windows Forms and the .net framework for a while in my spare time and enjoy it, but am somewhat worried about the headaches caused by interop. While this particular branch of the UI won't require much interop with the legacy C++ codebase, I can forsee this becoming an issue in the future.

The alternative is just to continue with MFC, but try and take advantage of the new feature pack that shipped with VS2008. This I guess is the easiest option, but I worry about longevity and not taking advantage of the goodness that is .net...

So, which do I pick? We're a small team so my recommendation will quite probably be accepted as a future direction for our development - I want to get it right.

Is MFC dead? Is C#/Winforms the way forward? Is there anything else I'm totally missing? Help greatly appreciated!

I know this question seems simple - and I'm sure there's a simple answer, but I've been spinning my wheels for some time on this one. I am dealing with a legacy db which really can't be altered structurally. I have a details table which lists payment plans that have been accepted by a customer. Each payment plan has an ID which links back to a reference table to get the plan's terms, conditions, etc. In my object model, I have an AcceptedPlan class, and a Plan class. Originally, I used a many-to-one relationship from the detail table back to the ref table to model this relationship in NHibernate. I also created a one-to-many relationship going in the opposite direction from the Plan class over to the AcceptedPlan class. This was fine while I was simply reading data. I could go to my Plan object, which was a property of my AcceptedPlan class to read the plan's details. My problem arose when I had to start inserting new rows to the details table. From my reading, it seems the only way to create a new child object is to add it to the parent object and then save the session. But I don't want to have to create a new parent Plan object every time I want to create a new detail record. This seems like unnecessary overhead. Does anyone know if I am going about this in the wrong way?##C##<c#><nhibernate>##C##@$R$@

To make a really long story short I am getting XML from a webservice of serialized objects.  I have a page limit of how many things can be on a page.  I've taken a data grid and made it page, sort across pages, and handle some basic filtering.  

In regards to paging I'm using a Dictionary keyed on the page and storing the XML for that page.  This way whenever a user comes back to a page that I've saved into this dictionary I can grab the XML from local memory instead of hitting the webservice.  Basically, I'm caching the data retrieved from each call to the webservice for a page of data.

There are several things that can expire my cache.  Filtering and sorting are the main reason.  However, a user may edit a row of data in the grid by opening an editor.  The data they edit could cause the data displayed in the row to be stale.  I could easily go to the webservice and get the whole page of data, but since the page size is set at runtime I could be looking at a large amount of records to retrieve.

So let me now get to the heart of the issue that I am experiencing.  In order to prevent getting the whole page of data back I make a call to the webservice asking for the completely updated record (the editor handles saving its data).

Since I'm using custom objects I need to serialize them on the server to XML (this is handled already for other portions of our software).  All data is handled through XML in e4x.  The cache in the Dictionary is stored as an XMLList.

Now let me show you my code...

    var idOfReplacee:String = this._WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.*[0].*[0].@Id;
    var xmlToReplace:XMLList = this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data.(@Id == idOfReplacee);

    if(xmlToReplace.length() > 0)
    {
        delete (this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data.(@Id == idOfReplacee)[0]);
        this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data += this._WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.*[0].*[0];
    }

Basically, I get the id of the node I want to replace.  Then I find it in the cache's Data property (XMLList).  I make sure it exists since the filter on the second line returns the XMLList.

The problem I have is with the delete line.  I cannot make that line delete that node from the list.  The line following the delete line works.  I've added the node to the list.

How do I replace or delete that node (meaning the node that I find from the filter statement out of the .Data property of the cache)???

Hopefully the underscores for all of my variables do not stay escaped when this is posted! otherwise this.&#95 == this._

I need to be able to generate a deep clone of this object - so I write a Clone() method, and implement it with a simple BinaryFormatter serialize/deserialize - or perhaps I do the deep clone using some other technique which is more error prone and I'd like to make sure is tested.

OK, so now (ok, I should have done it first) I'd like write tests which cover the cloning.  All the members of the class are private, and my architecture is so good (!) that I haven't needed to write hundreds of public properties or other accessors.  The class isn't IComparable or IEquatable, because that's not needed by the application.  My unit tests are in a separate assembly to the production code.

What approaches do people take to testing that the cloned object is a good copy?   Do you write (or *rewrite* once you discover the need for the clone) all your unit tests for the class so that they can be invoked with *either* a 'virgin' object *or* with a clone of it?   How would you test if part of the cloning wasn't deep enough - as this is just the kind of problem which can give hideous-to-find bugs later?

I have developed a code-generator that takes our python interface to our C++ code (generated via SWIG) and generates code needed to expose this as WebServices.  When I developed this code I did it using TDD, but I've found my tests to be brittle as hell.  Because each test essentially wanted to verify that for a given bit of input code (which happens to be a C++ header) I'd get a given bit of outputted code I wrote a small engine that reads test definitions from XML input files and generates test cases from these expectations.

The problem is I dread going in to modify the code at all.  That and the fact that the unit tests themselves are a: complex, and b: brittle.

So I'm trying to think of alternative approaches to this problem, and it strikes me I'm perhaps tackling it the wrong way.  Maybe I need to focus more on the outcome, IE: does the code I generate actually run and do what I want it to, rather than, does the code look the way I want it to.

I rolled my own "Cache", because I didn't know any better, it looked a bit like this:

    public class DataManager
    {
          
          private static DataManager s_instance;
       
          public static DataManager GetInstance()
          {
          }

          private Data[] m_myData;
          private DataTime m_cacheTime;

          public Data[] GetData()
          {
                TimeSpan span = DateTime.Now.Substract(m_cacheTime);

                if(span.TotalSeconds > 10)
                {
                      // Do SQL to get data
                      m_myData = data;
                      m_cacheTime = DateTime.Now;
                      return m_myData;     
                }
                else
                {
                      return m_myData;
                }
          }

    }

So the values are stored for a while in a singleton, and when the time expires, the values are renewed. If time has not expired, and a request for the data is done, the stored values in the field are returned.

What are the benefits over using the real method ([http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa478965.aspx][1]) instead of this?

I wish to design a workflow host environment that has high availability - a minimum of 2 WF runtime hosts on separate hardware both pointing to the same persistance or tracking SQL database.

I am looking for a pattern whereby I can asynchronously create new workflow instances based on some external event (i.e. some piece of data is updated in DB by a different application). For each event I need to create exactly one workflow instance and doesn't matter which host that instance is created on. There is also some flexibility regarding the duration of time between the event and when the workflow instance is actually created.

One solution I am considering is having a WCF interface on the WF hosts and placing them behind some sort of load balancer. It would then be up to whatever part of the system that is firing the "event" to make the WCF call.

I'm not really happy with this because if both\all WF hosts are down, or otherwise unavailable, the event could be "lost". Also, I won't be able manage load the way I would like to. I envisage a situation where there may be lots of events in a small period of time, but it's perfectly acceptable to handle those events some time later.

So I reckon I need to persist the events somehow and decouple the event creation from the event handling.

Is putting these events into MSMQ, or a simple event table in SQL Server, and having the WF host just poll the queue periodically a viable solution? Polling seems to be a such a dirty word though...

Would NServiceBus and durable messaging be useful here?

Any insights would be much appreciated.

OK, I have Google'd this and already expecting a big fat **NO!!** But I thought I should ask since I know sometimes there can be the odd little gem of knowledge lurking around in peoples heads ^_^

I am working my way through some excercises in a book for study, and this particular exercise is User Controls. I have cobbled together a control and would like to set the DefaultEvent for it (having done this for previous controls) so when I double-click it, the default event created is whatever I specify it to be. 

**NOTE:** This is a standard User Control (.ascx), _NOT_ a custom rendered control.
##Current Code
Here is the class & event definition:

    [System.ComponentModel.DefaultEvent("OKClicked")]
    public partial class AddressBox : System.Web.UI.UserControl
    {

        public event EventHandler OKClicked;

##Current Result
Now, when I double click the the control when it is on a ASPX page, the following is created:

        protected void AddressBox1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

        }

Not quite what I was expecting! So, my question:

There are two or more object collections of different types. You want to combine them into a single sortable and filterable collection (withing having to manually implement sort or filter).

One of the approaches I've considered is to create a new object collection with only a few core properties, including the ones that I would want the collection sorted on, and an object instance of each type. 

    class MyCompositeObject
    {
        enum           ObjectType;
        DateTime       CreatedDate;
        string         SomeAttribute;
        myObjectType1  Obj1;
        myObjectType2  Obj2;
    {
    class MyCompositeObjects : List<MyCompositeObject> { }

And then loop through my two object collectiosn to build the new composite collection. Obviously this is a bit of a brute force method, but it would work. I'd get all the default view sorting and filtering behavior on my new composite object collection, and I'd be able to put a data template on it to display my list items properly depending on which type is actually stored in that composite item.

In the past, I've open-sourced quite a few PHP scripts and UNIX-based stuff. For those, I typically went with a BSD/Apache style license, unless I was including a library that prevented it. On the Linux/PHP side of things, that usually meant something that was GPL-ed, thus still resulting in a fairly clear-cut arrangement.

For this project, however, I'm trying to figure out which licenses are even **possible** to apply to this project and not finding any good resource to answer the question. I know that the only "real" answer to this question would involve a lawyer. However, as this isn't something that's going to generate revenue, if I'm going to kick in $1000 toward the project, I'd rather hire a graphic designer or a usability expert to take a pass at the application than pay a lawyer.

This particular project also uses Subsonic for database access and Argotic for RSS parsing, further complicating the issue. 

I know that I'm allowed to use all of those pieces and that I can redistribute my project that uses them all. However, what I'm left with is confusion over what the resulting project can/must be licensed under.

I can probably negotiate my way through the maze for the Subsonic and Argotic bits because they're already under open source licenses, but I can't be the only one trying to figure out what license I can apply to a project I write on top of ASP.NET MVC.##C##<asp.net><mvc><opensource><licensing><subsonic><argotic>##C##@$R$@

Did XPATH as a specification precede namespaces?  If I have a document where elements have been given a default namespace: 

>> &lt;foo xmlns="uri" />

It appears as though some of the XPATH processor libraries won't recognize //foo because of the namespace whereas others will. The option my team has thought about is to add a namespace prefix using regular expressions to the XPATH (you can add a namespace prefix via XmlNameTable) but this seems brittle since XPATH is such a flexible language when it comes to node tests.

Is there a standard that applies to this?

My approach is a bit hackish but it seems to work fine; I remove the xmlns declaration with a search/replace and then apply xpaths.

>string readyForXpath = Regex.Replace( xmldocument, "xmlns=\".+\"", String.Empty );

I think a similar pattern could be used for taking an XML or tab-delimited file and parse it into their representative objects.

A common data structure would include:

> (Header) (DataElement1) (DataElement1SubData1) (DataElement1SubData2)(DataElement2) (DataElement2SubData1) (DataElement2SubData2) (EOF)

I think a good design would include a way to change out the parsing definition based on the file type or some defined metadata included in the header.  So a [Factory Pattern][1] would be part of the overall design for the Parser part.

I'm in the middle of designing an app that does something like portfolio management.  The design I have so far is

* Problem: a problem that needs to be solved
* Solution: a proposed solution to one or more problems
* Relationship: a relationship among two problems, two solutions, or a problem and a solution.  Further broken down into:
  * Parent-child - some sort of categorization / tree hierarchy
  * Overlap - the degree to which two solutions or two problems really address the same concept
  * Addresses - the degree to which a problem addresses a solution

My question is about the temporal nature of these things.  Problems crop up, then fade.  Solutions have an expected resolution date, but that might be modified as they are developed.  The degree of a relationship might change over time as problems and solutions evolve.

So, the question: what is the best design for versioning of these things so I can get both a current and an historical perspective of my portfolio?##C##<time><design><portfolio-management><risk-management>##C##@$R$@

Since many hosting companies offer a single database with their hosting plans (with additional databases costing extra) it is very useful for your users when your database objects (tables, views, constraints, and stored procedures) have a common prefix. It is typical for applications aware of database scarcity to have a hard-coded table prefix. I want more, however. Specifically, I'd like to have a table prefix that users can designate&mdash;say in the web.config file (with an appropriate default, of course).

Since I hate coding [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create%2C_read%2C_update_and_delete) operations by hand, I prefer to work through a competent OR/M and have used (and enjoyed) LINQ to SQL, Subsonic, and ADO.Net. I'm having some thrash in a new project, however, when it comes to putting a table prefix in a user's web.config file. Are there any .Net-based OR/M products that can handle this scenario elegantly?

The best I have been able to come up with so far is using LINQ to SQL with an external mapping file that I'd have to update somehow based on an as-yet hypothetical web.config setting.

Anyone have a better solution? I tried to make it happen in Entity Framework, but that turned into a mess quickly. (Due to my unfamiliarity with EF? Possibly.) How about SubSonic? Does it have an option to apply a table prefix besides at code generation time?##C##<.net><orm><data><table>##C##@$R$@

            return Convert.ToBase64String(ms.ToArray());
        }

            return System.Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetString(ms.ToArray());
        }

The code appears to work fine, except that when decrypting data with an <u>incorrect</u> key, I get a CryptographicException - "Padding is invalid and cannot be removed" - on the cs.Close() line in decryptString. 

example code:

        string password1 = "password";
        string password2 = "letmein";
        string startClearText = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
        string cipherText = encryptString(startClearText, password1);
        string endClearText = decryptString(cipherText, password2);     // exception thrown

My question is, is this to be expected? I would have thought that decrypting with the wrong password would just result in nonsense output, rather than an exception.

    it (Yes, I can pretty much rely on
    that -- it's an intranet and
    therefore will have times of
    non-use)
 2. Publish when new updates are made to
    the trunk (dependent on build
    success of course)
 3. If 2 is true, then that seems bad if someone is using that specific page or DLL and it gets overwritten.

...I'm sure there are lots of great places for this kind of thing, but I didn't use the right google search terms.

If this format is correct, the bytes must first be converted to UTF-8 characters. Each of these characters allocates 8 bytes. Are the bytes stored in base 10, hex, or binary characters? How much larger does the file appear as it is being sent due to the XML data and character encoding? Is there any compression built into web services?

First of all, the "browse" button looks different on every browser.  Unlike the "submit" button on a form, you have to come up with some [hack-y](http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/inputfile.html) way to style it.

Secondly, there's no progress indicator showing you how much of the file has uploaded.  You usually have to implement some kind of client-side way to disable multiple submits (e.g. change the submit button to a disabled button showing "Form submitting... please wait.") or flash a giant warning "DO NOT SUBMIT TWICE.'

So, my question is: Is there a good way to unit test a timer based class?

The problem, as I see it, is that there is a big risk that the tests will take uncomfortably long to execute, since they must wait so and so long for the desired actions to happen. Especially if one want realistic data (seconds), and not use the minimal time resolution allowed by the framework (1 ms?). I am using a mock object for the action, to register the number of times the action was called, and so that the action takes practically no time.

I have been tasked with migrating the old data into the new schema. I have decided to do this by creating a small Windows Forms project as the schema are radically different and straight TSQL scripts are not an adequate solution.

The main sealed class 'ImportController' that does the work declares the following delegate event:

    public delegate void ImportProgressEventHandler(object sender, ImportProgressEventArgs e);
    public static event ImportProgressEventHandler importProgressEvent;

The main window starts a static method in that class using a new thread:

    Thread dataProcessingThread = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(ImportController.ImportData));
    dataProcessingThread.Name = "Data Importer: Data Processing Thread";
    dataProcessingThread.Start(settings);

the ImportProgressEvent args carries a string message, a max int value for the progress bar and an current progress int value. The Windows form subcribes to the event:

    ImportController.importProgressEvent += new ImportController.ImportProgressEventHandler(ImportController_importProgressEvent);

And responds to the event in this manner using it's own delegate:

        private delegate void TaskCompletedUIDelegate(string completedTask, int currentProgress, int progressMax);
    
    private void ImportController_importProgressEvent(object sender, ImportProgressEventArgs e)
                {
                    this.Invoke(new TaskCompletedUIDelegate(this.DisplayCompletedTask), e.CompletedTask, e.CurrentProgress, e.ProgressMax);
                }

Finally the progress bar and listbox are updated:

    private void DisplayCompletedTask(string completedTask, int currentProgress, int progressMax)
            {
                string[] items = completedTask.Split(new string[] { Environment.NewLine }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
    
                foreach (string item in items)
                {
                    this.lstTasks.Items.Add(item);
                }
                            
                if (currentProgress >= 0 && progressMax > 0 && currentProgress <= progressMax)
                {
                    this.ImportProgressBar.Maximum = progressMax;
                    this.ImportProgressBar.Value = currentProgress;
                }
            }

It was traced to the control folder (not sure what it's real name is), the existing working builds were using _svn. Clearing the working folder forced a new complete checkout and I noticed that now the control folder is .svn. It looks like originally our integration routines were checking out code using _svn but now it is using .svn.

*The svn.exe being used during integration is from VisualSVN Server can I set this up to use _svn again?*

How the original working copies were using _svn I don't know! - we only ever ever used VisualSVN Server and haven't changed this.

We had setup TortoiseSVN to use _svn following the recommendation that this works better for Visual Studio and have also installed TortoiseSVN on the build server in case it is ever needed. Could this be the cause?

As far as I know there is no mscorlib.XmlSerializers.DLL, I think the DLL name has bee auto generated by .Net looking for the serializer. 

You have the option of creating a myApplication.XmlSerializers.DLL when compiling to optimise serializations, so I assume this is part of the framework's checking for it.

The problem is that this appears to be causing a delay in loading the application - it seems to hang for a few seconds at this point.

Any ideas how to avoid this or speed it up?##C##<c#><.net><assembly><serialization>##C##@$R$@

Most of those settings are there to customize certain business rules, but there's also some other stuff in there.

The app contains objects that specifically do a certain task, e.g., a certain complicated calculation. Those non-UI objects are unit-tested, but also need access to lots of those global settings. The way we've implemented this right now, is by giving the objects properties that are filled by the Application Controller at runtime. When testing, we create the objects in the test and fill in values for testing (not from the database).

This works better, in any case much better than having all those objects need some global _Settings_ object --- that of course effectively makes unit testing impossible :) Disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties, or that you need to let those properties 'percolate' into sub-objects.

**So the general question is**: how do you provide access to global application settings in your projects, without the need for global variables, while still being able to unit test your code? This must be a problem that's been solved 100's of times...

I've seen mention of doing this with something like CC.NET (although on ASP.NET actually), but is there any way to do it without any extra software?  I've done similar things in C/C++ before using build batch scripts, but in was accomplished by reading the version number, then having the script write out a file called "ver.h" everytime with something to the effect of:

    #define MAJORVER 4
    #define MINORVER 23
    #define SOURCEVER 965

We would then use these defines to generate the version string.

Is something like this possible for .NET?

My team is about to embark on a large project that will hopefully drag together all of the random one-off codebases that have evolved through the years. Given that this project will cover standardizing logical entities across the company ("Customer", "Employee"), small tasks, large tasks that control the small tasks, and utility services, I'm struggling to figure out the best way to structure the namespaces and code structure.

Though I guess I'm not giving you enough specifics to go on, **do you have any resources or advice on how to approach splitting your domains up logically**? In case it helps, most of this functionality will be revealed via web services, and we're a Microsoft shop with all the latest gizmos and gadgets.

I'm debating one massive solution with subprojects to make references easier, but will that make it too unwieldy? Should I wrap up legacy application functionality, or leave that completely agnostic in the namespace (making an "OurCRMProduct.Customer" class versus a generic "Customer" class, for instance)? Should each service/project have its own BAL and DAL, or should that be an entirely separate assembly that everything references? I don't have experience with organizing such far-reaching projects, only one-offs, so I'm looking for any guidance I can get.##C##<namespace>##C##@$R$@

Let's say you have a maintenance plan with a task to check the database, something like this:

    USE [MyDb]
    GO
    DBCC CHECKDB with no_infomsgs, all_errormsgs

If you go look in your logs after the task executes, you might see something like this:

    08/15/2008 06:00:22,spid55,Unknown,DBCC CHECKDB (mssqlsystemresource) executed by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM found 0 errors and repaired 0 errors. Elapsed time: 0 hours 0 minutes 0 seconds.

Instead of checking MyDb, it checked master and msssqlsystemresource.

Why?

My workaround is to create a Sql Server Agent Job with this:

    dbcc checkdb ('MyDb') with no_infomsgs, all_errormsgs;

That always works fine.

But we still have thousands of lines of business logic in stored procedures, which only really get tested in anger when our product is rolled out to a large number of users. 

What makes this worse is that some of these stored procedures end up being very long, because of the performance hit when passing temporary tables between SPs. This has prevented us from refactoring to make the code simpler.

We have made several attempts at building unit tests around some of our key stored procedures (primarily testing the performance), but have found that setting up the test data for these tests is really hard. For example, we end up copying around test databases. In addition to this, the tests end up being really sensitive to change, and even the smallest change to a stored proc. or table requires a large amount of changes to the tests. So after many builds breaking due to these database tests failing intermittently, we’ve just had to pull them out of the build process.

So, the main part of my questions is: has anyone ever successfully written unit tests for their stored procedures?

The second part of my questions is whether unit testing would be/is easier with linq? 

I was thinking that rather than having to set up tables of test data, you could simply create a collection of test objects, and test your linq code in a “linq to objects” situation? (I am a totally new to linq so don’t know if this would even work at all)

I've run across the usual suspects (indexus sharedcache, memcached), however, each has some limitations.

  - **Indexus** - Very immature, stubbed session interface implementation.  Its otherwise a great caching solution, though.
  - **Memcached** - Little replication/failover support without going to a db backend.
Several SF.Net projects - All aborted in the early stages... nothing that appears to have any traction, and one which seems to have gone all commercial.

So, let's try to tackle the problem all three ways.  How do you go from an arithmetic expression (e.g. in a string) such as "2 + (2)" to an expression tree using cascaded-if's, a table of function pointers, and/or polymorphism?  

Feel free to tackle one, two, or all three.

I've drawn up most of the plans but am having a hard time figuring out a way to handle the auditing system.

Since it is being used internally only and you won't even be able to touch the db from outside the building we are not using a login system as the program will only be used once a user has already logged in to our internal network via Active Directory.  Knowing this, we're using [a system to detect automatically the name of the Active Directory user][1] and with their permissions in one of the DB tables, deciding what they can or cannot do.

So the actual audit table will have 3 columns (this design may change but for this question it doesn't matter); who (Active Directory User), when (time of addition/deletion/edit), what (what was changed)

My question is how should I be handling this.  Ideally I know I should be using a trigger so that it is impossible for the database to be updated without an audit being logged, however I don't know how I could grab the Active Directory User that way.  An alternate would be to code it directly into the Access source so that whenever something changes I run an INSERT statement.  Obviously that is flawed because if something happens to Access or the database is touched by something else then it will not log the audit.

Any advice, examples or articles that may help me would be greatly appreciated!

**WebClient**  
Nice and easy but you do not get any notification that the asynchronous upload has completed, and the **UploadProgressChanged** event doesnt get called back with anything useful. The alternative is to convert your binary data to a string and use **UploadStringASync** because then at least you get a **UploadStringCompleted**, problem is you need a lot of ram for big files as its encoding all the data and uploading it in one go.

**HttpWebRequest**  
Bit more complicated but still does what is needed, problem I am getting is that even though it is called on a background thread (supposedly), it still seems to be blocking my UI and the whole browser until the upload has completed which doesnt seem quite right.

Normal .net does have some appropriate WebClient methods for [OnUploadDataCompleted][1] and progress but these arent available in Silverlight .net ... big omission I think!

Does anyone have any solutions, I need to upload multiple binary files preferrably with a progress but I need to perform some actions when the files have completed their upload.

Look forward to some help with this.

Before the doubters and dreamers cry out "how on earth?", relax--I haven't found a way to make late static binding work--I'm just working around it in the best way that I possibly can.

Anyway, I'm not currently using prepared statements for querying, because I couldn't come up with a way to pass a variable number of arguments to the bind_params() or bind_result() methods. 

Why do I need to support a variable number of arguments, you ask? Because the superclass of my models (think of my solution as a hacked-up PHP ActiveRecord wannabe) is where the querying is defined, and so the find() method, for example, doesn't know how many parameters it would need to bind.

Now, I've already thought of building an argument list and passing a string to eval(), but I don't like that solution very much--I'd rather just implement my own security checks and pass on statements.

Does anyone have any suggestions (or success stories) about how to get this done? If you can help me solve this first problem, perhaps we can tackle binding the result set (something I suspect will be more difficult, or at least more resource-intensive if it involves an initial query to determine table structure).##C##<php><mysql><mysqli><objectrelationalmapping>##C##@$R$@

I'm currently using the GD function imagecopyresampled to take hi-res images, and cleanly resize them down to a size for web viewing (roughly 700 pixels wide by 700 pixels tall). 

This works great on small (under 2MB photos) and the entire resize operation takes less than a second on the server. However, the site will eventually service photographers who may be uploading images up to 10MB in size (or images up to 5000x4000 pixels in size).

Doing this kind of resize operation with large images tends to increase the memory usage by a very large margin (larger images can spike the memory usage for the script past 80mb). Is there any way to make this resize operation more efficient? Should I be using an alternate image library such as ImageMagik?

Right now, the resize code looks something like this

    function makeThumbnail($sourcefile, $endfile, $thumbwidth, $thumbheight, $quality){
 //takes the sourcefile (path/to/image.jpg) and makes a thumbnail from it
 // and places it at endfile (path/to/thumb.jpg)

When the button is clicked, the modal popup opens but the Button_Click event is never fired, so the modal doesn't get its session data.

I know that this is often a highly debated topic, as far as whether or not returning DataTables is a good practice.  Let's put that aside for a moment.

When I create a DataTable from scratch, as below, there are no problems whatsoever.  The table is created, populated, and returned to the client, and all is well:

    [DataContract]
    public DataTable GetTbl()
    {
        DataTable tbl = new DataTable("testTbl");
        for(int i=0;i<100;i++)
        {
            tbl.Columns.Add(i);
            tbl.Rows.Add(new string[]{"testValue"});
        }
        return tbl;
    }


However, as soon as I go out and hit the database to create the table, as below, I get a CommunicationException "The underlying connection was closed: The connection was closed unexpectedly."

    [DataContract]
    public DataTable GetTbl()
    {
        DataTable tbl = new DataTable("testTbl");
        //populate table with sql query
        return tbl;
    }

The table is being populated correctly on the server side.  It is significantly smaller than the test table that I looped through and returned, and the query is small and fast - there is no issue here with timeouts or large data transfer.  The same exact functions and DataContracts/ServiceContracts/BehaviorContracts are being used.  

Why would the way that the table is being populated have any bearing on the table returning successfully??##C##<.net><webservices><wcf><datatable>##C##@$R$@

Firefox applies the formatting correctly, but IE puts the entire code block on one line. If I add an alert

If I reload the page, the number following jQuery changes.

If I use wrap() instead of wrapInner(), to wrap the &lt;pre&gt; outside the &lt;code&gt; tag, both IE and Firefox handle it correctly. But shouldn't &lt;pre&gt; work _inside_ &lt;code&gt; as well?

I'd prefer to use wrapInner() because I can then add a CSS class to the &lt;pre&gt; tag to handle all formatting, but if I use wrap(), I have to put page formatting CSS in the &lt;pre&gt; tag and text/font formatting in the &lt;code&gt; tag, or Firefox and IE both choke.

I've worked on one project in which we placed a heavy emphasis on creating high-level automated tests which exercised all the functionality of a given use case/user story.  It was really amazing to me how much easier development became after we began this practice.  Implementing features became so much easier after writing a test and we were able to make major architectural changes to the system with all the confidence in the world that everything still worked the same as it did yesterday.

The biggest problem we ran into was that the tools for managing these types of tests aren't very good.  We used Fitnesse quite a bit and as a result I now hate the Fit framework.

Think Craigslits, where you search for "dvd' but the results are not from all the DB, they are filtered by a location you select. My question has 2 levels:

 1. should I go a-la-craigslit, and ask users to use a city level location? My problem with this is that you need to generate what seems to me a hardcoded, hand made list of locations. 
 2. should I go a-la-zipCode. The idea of just asking the user to type his zipcode, and then pool all items that are in the same or in a certain distance from his zip code.

I seem to prefer the zip code way as it seems more elegant solution, but how on earth do one goes about creating a DB of all zip codes and implement the function that given zip code 12345, gets all zipcodes in 1 mile distance?

this should be fairly common "task" as many sites have a need similar to mine, so I am hoping not to re-invent the wheel here.

In tweaking that class to work with Oracle, we've come across an interesting question. Is it better to use DBNull.Value, or null? Are there any benefits to using DBNull.Value? It seems more "correct" to use null, since we've separated ourselves from the DB world, but there are implications (you can't just blindly ToString() when a value is null for example) so its definitely something we need to make a conscious decision about.##C##<c#><bestpractices><null><dbnull>##C##@$R$@

Summer (5-1 to 8-31) 
Spring  (3-1 to 4-30) 
Fall (9-1 to 10-31)
Winter (11-1 to 2-28)

If I'm in group A, here would be my allowed times:
Winter: Mondays only
Spring: Tues, Thurs, Sat
Summer: Any Day
Fall: Tues, Thurs, Sat

If I was writing this in PHP I would use arrays like this:
//M=Monday,t=Tuesday,T=Thursday.... etc
$schedule["A"]["Winter"]='M';
$schedule["A"]["Spring"]='tTS';
$schedule["A"]["Summer"]='Any';
$schedule["A"]["Fall"]='tTS';
$schedule["B"]["Winter"]='t';

I COULD make the days arrays (array("Tuesday","Thursday","Saturday")) etc, but it is not necessary for what I'm really trying to accomplish.

I will also need to setup arrays to determine what season I'm in:

$seasons["Summer"]["start"]=0501;
$seasons["Summer"]["end"]=0801;

Can anyone suggest a really sexy way to do this? I will have today's date and the group letter.  I will need to get out of my function a day (M) or a series of days (tTS), (Any).

When wsdl.exe is run, it will automatically create proxy classes that contain just the data portion, and these will be automatically converted to and from my real business objects on the server side.  On the client side, they will only get to use the dumb proxy type, and they will have to map them into some real business objects as they see fit.  A big drawback here is that if I "own" both the server and client side, and I want to use the same set of real business objects, I can run into certain headaches with name conflicts, etc.  (Since the real objects and the proxies are named the same.)

OR

 2. Forget trying to pass "real" business objects.  Instead, just create simple DataTransfer objects which I will map back and forth to my real business objects manually.  They still get copied to new proxy objects by wsdl.exe anyway, but at least I'm not tricking myself into thinking that web services can natively handle objects with business logic in them.

By the way - Does anyone know how to tell wsdl.exe to *not* make a copy of the object?  Shouldn't we be able to just tell it, "Hey, use this existing type right over here. Don't copy it!"

Anyway, I've kinda settled on #2 for now, but I'm curious what you all think.  I have a feeling there are *way* better ways to do this in general, and I may not even be totally accurate on all my points, so please let me know what your experiences have been.##C##<.net><webservices><soap><wsdl>##C##@$R$@

Problems:

 1. _**DRY violation**_ - I have N references to my Struts action URLs instead of 1, which makes refactoring action URLs error-prone.
 2. _**Mixed concerns**_ - My application's markup is now in more than just my JSP files, making it difficult for a web specialist to tweak the markup (using CSS, etc).
 3. _**Post-translation markup**_ - Anytime I receive newly-translated text, I must decide what to surround with the < a >...< /a > markup. Easy for English but less so for unfamiliar languages.

I've considered adding placeholders in the messages file, like:

    alert=Please update your {0} and {1}.

but then the words "address" and "contact information" would somehow need to be localized, wrapped with markup, and passed to my message tag - and I can't see an easy way to do it.

In listening to the Stack Overflow podcast, I heard Joel mention that FogBugz uses one database per client (so if there were 1000 clients, there would be 1000 databases).  What are the advantages to using this architecture?

I understand that for some projects clients need direct access to all of their data - in such an application, it's obvious that each client needs their own database.  However, for projects where a client does not need to access the database directly, are there any advantages to using one database per client?  It seems that in terms of flexibility, it's much simpler to use a single database with a single copy of the tables.  It's easier to add new features, it's easier to create reports, and it's just easier to manage.

I was pretty confident in the "one database for all clients" method until I heard Joel (an experienced developer) mention that his software uses a different approach -- and I'm a little confused with his decision...

I've heard people cite that databases slow down with a large number of records, but any relational database with some merit isn't going to have that problem - especially if proper indexes and keys are used.

On a form I can have one or more or my UserControl. I want to implement my own tab behavior so if the user presses Tab in the second TextBox I should only move to the third TextBox if the the second TextBox has anything entered. If nothing is entered in the second TextBox the next control of the form should get focus as per the normal tab behavior. If the user hasn't entered anything in the first or second TextBox and the presses tab there is this special case where a control on the form should be skipped. 

By using the ProcessDialogKey I have managed to get it work kind of ok but I still have one problem. My question is if there is a way to detect how a WinForms control got focus since I would also like to know if the my UserControl got focus from a Tab or Shift-Tab and then do my weird stuff but if the user clicks the control I don't want to do anything special. ##C##<c#><winforms>##C##@$R$@

So far I've been using this snippet to do it (I'm also using jQuery, hence the $() function):

    $("#thediv").scrollTop = $("#thediv").scrollHeight;

However it's been giving me inconsistent results. Sometimes it works, sometimes not, and it completely ceases to work if the user ever resizes the div or moves the scroll bar manually.

I think this is a fairly naive regular expression but it's a fine starting point for building something better.  But, my question is this:

What is the point of "{1}"?  It means "exactly one of the previous grouping", right?  Isn't that the default behavior of a grouping in a regular expression?  Would the expression be changed in any way if the {1} were removed?

If I saw this from a coworker I would point out his or her error but as I write this the response is rated at a 6 and the expression on regexlib.com is rated a 4 of 5.  So maybe I'm missing something?

First, there is a public website where external users can submit and update information for various purposes. This information is then saved to a local SQL Server at the colo facility.

The second aspect is an internal application which employees use to manage those same records (conceptually) and provide status updates, approvals, etc. This application is hosted within the corporate firewall with its own local SQL Server database.

The two networks are connected by a hardware VPN solution, which is decent, but obviously not the speediest thing in the world.

The two databases are similar, and share many of the same tables, but they are not 100% the same. Many of the tables on both sides are very specific to either the internal or external application.

So the question is: when a user updates their information or submits a record on the public website, how do you transfer that data to the internal application's database so it can be managed by the internal staff? And vice versa... how do you push updates made by the staff back out to the website?

It is worth mentioning that the more "real time" these updates occur, the better. Not that it has to be instant, just reasonably quick.

So far, I have thought about using the following types of approaches:

 1. Bi-directional replication
 2. Web service interfaces on both sides with code to sync the changes as they are made (in real time).
 3. Web service interfaces on both sides with code to asynchronously sync the changes (using a queueing mechanism).

Joel asked this question on a podcast a while back but I don't think it ever got resolved.  I'm in the same situation, so I'm also looking for the answer.  

I have multiple devices that all sync with MS-Outlook.  PCs, Laptops, Smartphones, PDAs, etc. all have the capability to synchronize their data (calendars, emails, contacts, etc.) with the Exchange server.  I like to use the Outlook meeting notice or appointment reminders to remind me of an upcoming meeting or doctors appointment or whatever.  The problem lies in the fact that all the devices pop up the same reminder and I have to go to every single device individually in order to snooze or dismiss all of the identical the reminder popups.  

Since this is a sync'ing technology, why doesn't the fact that I snooze or dismiss on one device sync up the other devices automatically.  I've even tried to force a sync after dismissing a reminder and it still shows up on my other devices after a forced sync.  This is utterly annoying to me.  

Is there a setting that I'm overlooking or is there a 3rd party reminder utility that I should be using instead of the built-in stuff?

Unfortunately Google decided not to upgrade the service to Firefox 3.0. Mozilla is developing a replacement for google browser sync which will be a part of the Weave project. I have tried using Weave and found it to be very very slow or totally inoperable. Granted they are in a early development phase right now so I can not really complain. 

This specific problem of browser sync got me to thinking though. What do all of you think of Mozilla or someone making a server/client package that we, the users, could run on your 'main' machine? Now you just have to know your own IP or have some way to announce it to your client browsers at work or wherever.

There are several problems I can think of with this: non static IPs, Opening up ports on your local comp etc. It just seems that Mozilla does not want to handle this traffic created by many people syncing their browsers. There is not a way for them to monetize this traffic since all the data uploaded must be encrypted.  ##C##<firefox><browsers><synchronization>##C##@$R$@

    insert into myTable (Col1, Col2) values (@col1, @col2)

My logic behind writing it in this way is that the update will perform an implicit select using the where clause and if that returns 0 then the insert will take place.

The alternative to doing it this way would be to do a select and then based on the number of rows returned either do an update or insert. This I considered inefficient because if you are to do an update it will cause 2 selects (the first explicit select call and the second implicit in the where of the update). If the proc where to do an insert then there'd be no difference in efficiency.

I would say ... satisfied.

In some way a felt uncomfortable, cause, there is no code and everything I was used to, but in the other hand I could speed up my developing. The fact is that eventually I returned to use C# because I find it more flexible to develop, I can make unit testing, use CVS, I have access to more resources and basically I had "all the control". I felt that this tool didn't give me confidence and I thought that later in the project I could not manage it due to its forced established rules of development. And also a lot of things like sending emails, using my own controls, and other things had their complication, it seemed that at some point it was not going to be as easy as initially I thought and as initially the product claims. This reminds me a very nice article called "[No Silver Bullet][2]".

This CASE had its advantages but on the other hand it doesn't have resources you can consult and actually the license and certification are very expensive. For me another dissapointing thing is that because of its simplistic approach for development I felt scared on first hand cause of my unexperience on these kind of tools and second cause I thought that if I continued using it maybe it would have turned to be a complex monster that I could not manage later in the project.

I think its good to use these kind of solutions to speed up things but I wonder, why aren't these programs as popular as VS.Net, J2EE, Ruby, Python, etc. if they claim to enhace productivity better than the tools I've pointed?

I prefer PDO for the single reason that it allows named parameters for prepared statements, and as far as I am aware mysqli does not.

What got me to thinking about this was the SO question about a stripslashes()-like function in Python. My first thought was "why not define your own and just call it when you need it", but it raised the question: is it preferable, for such a function, to let the interpreted language handle that overhead, or would it be better to write an extension and leverage the compiled language behind the interpreter?##C##<language-agnostic><performance><language-features><interpreted>##C##@$R$@

Additionally, I would love to have a second list to which the user can drag items from the first list onto.

So far, I found two solutions:

* The ReorderList from the [Ajax Control Toolkit][1], which requires a bit of manual work to make sure changes [are persisted][2] into the database, and that does not support drag/drop between lists.
* The [RadGrid][3] from Telerik which does all I want, but is priced far far beyond my Budget.

Does anyone else have some ideas or at least some keywords/pointers to do further investigation on? Espectially the Drag/Drop between two lists is something I am rather clueless about how to do that in ASP.net.

Target Framework is 3.0 by the way.

We are choosing between C (or maybe C++) and LabVIEW.  There are pros for each language.

C(++):

  - Widely used
  - Good preparation for the future (most programming positions require text-based programmers.)
  - We can expand upon our C codebase from last year
  - Allows us to better understand what our robot is doing.

LabVIEW

  - Easier to visualize program flow (blocks and wires, instead of lines of code)
  - Easier to teach (Supposedly...)
  - "The future of programming is graphical."  (Think so?)
  - Closer to the Robolab background that some new members may have.
  - Don't need to intimately know what's going on.  Simply tell the module to find the red ball, don't need to know how.

This is a very difficult decision for us, and we've been debating for a while.  Based on those pros for each language, and on the experience you've got, **what do you think the better option is?** Keep in mind that we aren't necessarily going for pure efficiency.  We also hope to prepare our programmers for a future in programming.

Also:

  - **Do you think that graphical languages such as LabVEIW are the future of programming?**
  - **Is a graphical language easier to learn than a textual language?**  I think that they should be about equally challenging to learn.
  -  Seeing as we are partailly rooted in helping people learn, **how much should we rely on prewritten modules, and how much should we try to write on our own?**  ("Good programmers write good code, great programmers copy great code."  But isn't it worth being a good programmer, first?)

I need some advice as to how I easily can separate test runs for unit tests and integration test in Visual Studio. Often, or always, I structure the solution as presented in the above picture: separate projects for unit tests and integration tests. The unit tests is run very frequently while the integration tests naturally is run when the context is correctly aligned.

My goal is to somehow be able configure which tests (or test folders) to run when I use a keyboard shortcut. The tests should preferably be run by a graphical test runner (ReSharpers). So for example

* Alt+1 runs the tests in project BLL.Test, 
* Alt+2 runs the tests in project DAL.Tests, 
* Alt+3 runs them both (i.e. all the tests in the [Tests] folder, and
* Alt+4 runs the tests in folder [Tests.Integration].

TestDriven.net have an option of running just the test in the selected folder or project by right-clicking it and select Run Test(s). Being able to do this, but via a keyboard command and with a graphical test runner would be awesome.

![TestDriven.net test run output][2]

Currently I use VS2008, ReSharper 4 and nUnit. But advice for a setup in the general is of course also appreciated.

To me they always represented some "magic" that was going to happen on the database side, far far away from the control of my application code. I also wanted to limit the amount of work the DB had to do, as it's generally a shared resource and I always assumed triggers could get to be expensive in high load scenarios.

That said, I have found a couple of instances where triggers have made sense to use (at least in my opinion they made sense). Recently though, I found myself in a situation where I sometimes might need to "bypass" the trigger. I felt really guilty about having to look for ways to do this, and I still think that a better database design would alleviate the need for this bypassing. Unfortunately this DB is used by mulitple applications, some of which are maintained by a very uncooperative development team who would scream about schema changes, so I was stuck.

What's the general consesus out there about triggers? Love em? Hate em? Think they serve a purpose in some scenarios?

My main concern now is that I may have a memory leak, since I'm handling the PreviewKeyDown event on UIElements and never explicitly "unhook" the event.

What's the best approach to prevent this leak (if indeed there is one)? Should I keep a list of the elements I'm managing, and unhook the PreviewKeyDown event in the Application.Exit event? Has anyone had success with attached behaviours in their own WPF applications and come up with an elegant memory-management solution?

How would you go adding unit-testing to a game?

I believe you can unit test a lot of the game engine's functionality (networking, object creation, memory management, etc), but is it possible to unit test the actual game itself?

I'm not talking about gameplay elements (like Protoss would beat Zerg in map X), but I'm talking about the interaction between the game and the engine.

**Introduction**

In game development, the engine is just a platform for the game. You could think of the game engine as an OS and the game as a software the OS would run. The game could be a collection of scripts or an actual subroutine inside the game engine.

**Possible Answers**

My idea is this: 

You would need an engine that is deterministic. This means that given one set of input, the output would be exactly the same. This would inlude the random generator being seeded with the same input.

Then, create a bare-bone level which contains a couple of objects the avatar/user can interact with. Start small and then add objects into the level as more interactions are developed.

Create a script which follows a path (tests pathfinding) and interact with the different objects (store the result or expected behavior). This script would be your unit test. After a certain amount of time (say, one week), run the script along with your engine's unit tests.

On the evaluation, I was very biased on their performance (perfect scores).

I'm glad that our programming shop doesn't require an average performance level but I heard horror stories of shops which do require an average level.

For our first year we've been using a "server" for sharing project files, a plain windows machine with a network share. But this isn't exactly future proof. 

SVN is great for code (it's what we use now), but I want to expand the versioning (or atleast some form of syncing) to cover all or most of our files. 

What we need is something that's multiplatform (atleast win/osx), usable by our non-developers, can handle larger files (100mb+) without croaking. 

I have a hunch that there's tons of ways to handle this, since it feels like something that should be a common problem. ##C##<versioning><version-control><filemanagement>##C##@$R$@

Wanted conversion is like this:

That is, CVS HEAD becomes a normal branch and CVS branchA becomes SVN trunk.

Both CVS and SVN repositories will be on same linux machine.

How could this be done? 

Also conversion where CVS branchA becomes SVN trunk and all other CVS branches are ignored might be enough.

Has anyone managed to get CruiseControl.net working with CVSDude?  My collegue Mike has this [blog post][2] where someone from CVSDude said:

server, which passes variables relating to the last checkin (variables

Sound lovely.  But has anyone *actually done it* with cruisecontrol?

./trunk  
./branches  
./tags

However, as we're moving down the road of OSGi and a modular project, we've ended up with:

./trunk/bundle/main  
./trunk/bundle/modulea  
./trunk/bundle/moduleb
./tags/bundle/main-1.0.0  
./tags/bundle/main-1.0.1  
./tags/bundle/modulea-1.0.0

The 'build' is still quite monolithic in that it builds all modules in sequence, thou I'm starting to wonder if we should refactor the build/repository to something more like:

./bundle/main/trunk  
./bundle/main/tags/main-1.0.0  
./bundle/main/tags/main-1.0.1  
./bundle/modulea/trunk  
./bundle/modulea/tags/modulea-1.0.0  

In this pattern I would imagine each module building itself, and storing its binary in a repository (maven, ivy, or another path of the subversion repository itself).

    Color blended = Color.FromArgb(alpha, color);

or

    Color blended = Color.FromArgb(alpha, red, green , blue);

However in the Compact Framework (2.0 specifically), neither of those prototypes are valid, you only get:

    Color.FromArgb(int red, int green, int blue);

and

    Color.FromArgb(int val);

The first one, obviously, doesn't even let you enter an alpha value, but the documentation for the latter shows that "val" is a 32bit ARGB value (as 0xAARRGGBB as opposed to the standard 24bit 0xRRGGBB), so it would make sense that you could just build the ARGB value and pass it to the function.  I tried this with the following:

    private Color FromARGB(byte alpha, byte red, byte green, byte blue)
    {
        int val = (alpha << 24) | (red << 16) | (green << 8) | blue;
        return Color.FromArgb(val);
    }

But no matter what I do, the alpha blending never works, the resulting color always as full opacity, even when setting the alpha value to 0.

With the parser I am using, this is a two step process - first, the page content is parsed and all of the links to wiki pages from the source markup are extracted. Then, I feed an array of the existing pages back to the parser, before the final HTML markup is generated.

What is the best way to handle this process? It seems as if I need to keep a cached list of every single page on the site, rather than having to extract the index of page titles each time. Or is it better to check each link separately to see if it exists? This might result in a lot of database lookups if the list wasn't cached. Would this still be viable for a larger wiki site with thousands of pages?##C##<database><html><wiki><hyperlink>##C##@$R$@

What we need to do, is figure out the possible distinct values of this code, call another stored procedure to cross reference these discreet values and then update the result set with the newly deciphered values:

My question is then more focused on the best design solution.

What I want is a set of "helper" classes that all have their own static methods such that if I get objects A, B, and C from a third party vendor, I can have helper classes with methods such as
<pre>
AHelper.RetrieveByID(string id);
AHelper.RetrieveByName(string name);
AHelper.DumpToDatabase();
</pre>
Since my AHelper, BHelper, and CHelper classes will all basically have the same methods, it seems to makes sense to move these methods to an interface that these classes then derive from.  However, wanting these methods to be static precludes me from having a generic interface or abstract class for all of them to derive from.

I could always make these methods non-static and then instantiate the objects first such as
<pre>
AHelper a = new AHelper();
a.DumpToDatabase();
</pre>
However, this code doesn't seem as intuitive to me.  What are your suggestions?  Should I abandon using an interface or abstract class altogether (the situation I'm in now) or can this possibly be refactored to accomplish the design I'm looking for?##C##<.net><interface-design><abstract-class><static-methods>##C##@$R$@

The reason this has come about is because of reference problems we experienced in our previous project.  On a frequent basis people would mistakenly add a reference to an assembly in the wrong location, which would mean it would work okay on their local environment, but might break on someone else's or on the build machine.

Also, the reference paths are in the csproj.user files which means these must be committed to source control, so everyone has to share these same settings.

So we are thinking about having separate projects and solutions on our CI server, so that when we do a build it uses these projects rather than local development ones.

It has obvious drawbacks such as an overhead to maintaining these separate files and the associated process that would need to be defined and followed, but it has benefits in that we would be in more control over *EXACTLY* what happens in the production environment.  

What I haven't been able to find is anything on this subject - can't believe we are the only people to think about this - so all thoughts are welcome.

I have been looking online trying to find a real difference between the two and have asked on crackoverflow. The only major differences are a few syntax difference which are trivial to me because I am also a Java developer. What would be a good response to an interviewer when they tell me they are looking for a C# developer or some other similar question?  ##C##<c#><vb.net>##C##@$R$@

My question is this, I don't *see* anyone using this method and wonder if it is a good idea to keep using it.  If not, what method should I transition to instead?##C##<web-page><shtml><inclue-file>##C##@$R$@

    public interface Repository<E>
    {
       public void delete(E entity);
    }

    public abstract class AbstractRepository<E> 
       implements
       Repository<E>
    {
       public void delete(E entity){
          //...
       }
    }

    public interface FooRepository<Foo>
    {
       //other methods
    }

    @Local(FooRepository.class)
    @Stateless
    public class FooRepositoryImpl
        extends
        AbstractRepository<Foo> implements FooRepository
    {
       @Override
       public void delete(Foo entity){
          //do something before deleting the entity
          super.delete(entity);
       }

       //other methods

    }

And then another bean that accesses the FooRepository bean:

    //...

    @EJB
    private FooRepository fooRepository;
    
    public void someMethod(Foo foo)
    {
        fooRepository.delete(foo);
    }

    //...

However, the overriding method is never executed when the delete method of the FooRepository bean is called. Instead, only the implementation of the delete method that is defined in AbstractRepository is executed. What am I doing wrong or is it simply a limitation of Java/EJB 3 that generics and inheritance don't play well together yet?##C##<java><generics><inheritance><ejb-3.0><java-ee>##C##@$R$@

If you're not using these types of application frameworks what's stopping you?  Is it simply the inertia associated with any large IT organization.

I'm 99.9% sure that it's not file related, so not sure where to begin in the DB.  Unfortunately with DotNetNuke you don't get the YSOD, but a generic error, with no real way to find the actual exception that has occured.

I'm just curious if anyone has had similar deployment issues using the Database Publishing Wizard, and if so, how they overcame them?  I own the RedGate toolset, but some hosts like GoDaddy don't allow you to direct connect to their servers...

Does anyone who has any experience with this sort of stuff have any recommendations for reading / source code to examine? Or just general advice on what I should be trying to learn about if I want to get into the world of writing speech recognition programs (sometimes it's hard to know what to search for if you don't have much knowledge about the domain).##C##<speech-recognition><language-agnostic>##C##@$R$@

This project is the core of our application, and would drive any managed UI code that is produced (hence the need to turn on clr support for interop). 

After fixing a ton of little niggly errors and warnings, I finally managed to get the application to compile.. 
However, running the application causes an EETypeLoadException and leaves me unable to debug...

Doing some digging, I found the cause to be "System.TypeLoadException: Internal limitation: too many fields." which occurs right at the end of compilation. I then found [this link][1] which suggests to break the assembly down into two or more dlls. However, this is not possible in my case, as a limitation I have is that the legacy code basically remains untouched.

Can anyone suggest any other possible solutions? I'm really at a dead end here.

To do this I'm creating a context that wraps a bitmap with the same-size as the view, but I'm unsure how to draw the view hierarchy into it. I can draw a single view just be setting the context and explicitly calling drawRect, but this does not deal with all of the subviews.

I can't see anything in the NSView interface that could help with this so I suspect the solution may lie at a higher level.

How would you go about finding the best combination programmatically?


My best attempt so far (third or fourth algorithm) is:

1. Find the longest shipper for each leg
2. Eliminate the most "expensive" one
3. Find the cheapest shipper for each leg
4. Calculate the total cost & days
5. If days are acceptable, finish, else, goto 1

Quickly mocked-up in PHP (note that the test array below works swimmingly, but if you try it with the test array from above, it does not find the correct combination):

    $shippers["leg1"] = array(
     "UPS"    => array("days" => 1, "cost" => 4000),
     "Conway" => array("days" => 3, "cost" => 3200),
     "FedEx"  => array("days" => 8, "cost" => 1000)
    );
    
    $shippers["leg2"] = array(
     "UPS"    => array("days" => 1, "cost" => 3500),

     "FedEx"  => array("days" => 4, "cost" => 900)

Currently, that's pretty much the situation my group faces.  We do web-app development primarily (but no desktop development at this time).  Software deployments are ugly and unwieldy even with our modest apps, and we've had far too many issues crop up in the two years I have been a part of this team (and company).  It's past time to do something about that, and the upshot is that we'll be able to kill two Joel Test birds with one stone (daily builds and one-step builds, neither of which exists in any form whatsoever).

What I'm after here is some general insight on the kinds of things I need to be doing or thinking about, from people who have been in software development for longer than I have and also have bigger brains.  I'm confident that will be most of the people currently posting in the beta.

Relevant Tools:
Visual Build
Source Safe 6.0 (I know, but I can't do anything about whether or not we use Source Safe at this time.  That might be the next battle I fight.)

Tentatively, I've got a Visual Build project that does this:

1. Get source and place in local directory, including necessary DLLs needed for project.
2. Get config files and rename as needed (we're storing them in a special sub directory that isn't part of the actual application, and they are named according to use).
3. Build using Visual Studio
4. Precompile using command line, copying into what will be a "build" directory
5. Copy to destination.
6. Get any necessary additional resources - mostly things like documents, images, and reports that are associated with the project (and put into directory from step 5).  There's a lot of this stuff, and I didn't want to include it previously.  However, I'm going to only copy changed items, so maybe it's irrelevant.  I wasn't sure whether I really wanted to include this stuff in earlier steps.

I still need to coax some logging out of Visual Build for all of this, but I'm not at a point where I need to do that yet.

Does anyone have any advice or suggestions to make?  We're not currently using a Deployment Project, I'll note.  It would remove some of the steps necessary in this build I presume (like web.config swapping).

JavaScript can add, remove and modify nodes on the DOM tree to make changes to the page. I find it very nice to work with (browser bugs aside), and very different from the way my server-side code has to generate the page in the first place.

My question is: what server-side frameworks/languages build a page by treating it as a DOM tree from the beginning - inserting nodes instead of echoing strings? I think it would be very helpful if the client-side and server-side code both saw the page the same way. You could certainly hack something like this together in any web server language, but a framework dedicated to creating a page this way could make some very nice optimizations.

I realise that I am potentially opening a door to a whole world of disagreement about 'the best way to do things'. I both understand and respect the undeniable fact that each programmer has a prefered method of solving each individual task, as a result Im not looking to write anything so draconianly proscriptive as to stifle personal flair but to try and get a general methodology and agreed standards (e.g. naming conventions) to help make individuals code more readable.

1. Do you use source control? 
2. Can you make a build in one step? 
3. Do you make daily builds? 
4. Do you have a bug database? 

I'm just curious what free/cheap (but good) tools exist for the small development shops that don't have large bank accounts to use to achieve a positive answer on these questions.

For source control I know Subversion is a great solution, and if you are a one man shop you could even use SourceGear's [Vault][2].

I use NAnt for my larger projects, but have yet to set up a script to build my installers as well as running the obfusication tools all as a single step.  Any other suggestions?

If you can answer yes to the building in a single step, I think creating daily builds would be easy, but what tools would you recommend for automating those daily builds?

For a one or two man team, it's already been discussed on SO that you can use FogBugz On Demand, but what other bug tracking solutions exist for small teams?

None of these boxes are especially critical and they're all using RAID.  To date, I've therefore been doing backups of the boxes by having a cron job upload tarballs containing the contents of /etc, MySQL dumps and other such changing, non-packaged data to a box at our geographically separate hosting centre.

I've realised, however that

* the tarballs are sufficient to rebuild from, but it's certainly not a painless process to do so (I recently tried this out as part of a hardware upgrade of one of the boxes)
* long-term, the process isn't sustainable.  Each of the boxes is currently producing a tarball of a couple of hundred MB each day, 99% of which is the same as the previous day
* partly due to the size issue, the backup process requires more manual intervention than I want (to find whatever 5GB file is inflating the size of the tarball and kill it)
* again due to the size issue, I'm leaving stuff out which it would be nice to include - the contents of users' home directories, for example.  There's almost nothing of value there that isn't in source control (and these aren't our main dev boxes), but it would be nice to keep them anyway.
* there must be a better way

So, my question is, how should I be doing this properly?  The requirements are:

* needs to be an offsite backup (one of the main things I'm doing here is protecting against fire/whatever)
* should require as little manual intervention as possible (I'm lazy, and box-herding isn't my main job)
* should continue to scale with a couple more boxes, slightly more data, etc.
* preferably free/open source (cost isn't the issue, but especially for backups, openness seems like a good thing)
* an option to produce some kind of DVD/Blu-Ray/whatever backup from time to time wouldn't be bad

My first thought was that this kind of incremental backup was what tar was created for - create a tar file once each month, add incrementally to it.  rsync results to remote box.  But others probably have better suggestions.

It appears that the pointer you get back from new[] is not always the same as the address you pass in (5.3.4, note 12 in the standard seems to confirm that this is correct), but I don't see how you can allocate a buffer for the array to go in if this is the case.

The following example shows the problem. Compiled with Visual Studio, this example results in memory corruption:


 #include <new>
 #include <stdio.h>

 class A
 {
 public:

  A() : data(0) {}
  virtual ~A() {}
  int data;
 };

 int main(int argc, char* argv[])
 {
  const int NUMELEMENTS=20;

  char *pBuffer = new char[NUMELEMENTS*sizeof(A)];
  A *pA = new(pBuffer) A[NUMELEMENTS];

  // With VC++, pA will be four bytes higher than pBuffer
  printf("Buffer address: %x, Array address: %x\n", pBuffer, pA);
  
  // Debug runtime will assert here due to heap corruption
  delete[] pBuffer;

  return 0;
 }

Looking at the memory, the compiler seems to be using the first four bytes of the buffer to store a count of the number of items in it. This means that because the buffer is only <code>sizeof(A)*NUMELEMENTS</code> big, the last element in the array is written into unallocated heap.

So the question is can you find out how much additional overhead your implementation wants in order to use placement new[] safely? Ideally, I need a technique that's portable between different compilers. Note that, at least in VC's case, the overhead seems to differ for different classes. For instance, if I remove the virtual destructor in the example, the address returned from new[] is the same as the address I pass in.##C##<c++>##C##@$R$@

I am aware that Microsoft has a rule of thumb stating that a SSRS report should take no longer than 30 seconds to execute.  However sometimes gargantuan reports are a preferred evil due to external forces such complying with state laws.

At my place of employment, we have an asp.net (2.0) app that we have migrated from Crystal Reports to SSRS. Due to the large user base and complex reporting UI requirements we have a set of screens that accepts user inputted parameters and creates schedules to be run over night. Since the application supports multiple reporting frameworks we do not use the scheduling/snapshot facilities of SSRS. All of the reports in the system are generated by a scheduled console app which takes user entered parameters and generates the reports with the corresponding reporting solutions the reports were created with. In the case of SSRS reports, the console app generates the SSRS reports and exports them as PDFs via the SSRS web service API. 

So far SSRS has been much easier to deal with than Crystal with the exception of a certain 25,000 page report that we have recently converted from crystal reports to SSRS. The SSRS server is a 64bit 2003 server with 32 gigs of ram running SSRS 2005. All of our smaller reports work fantastically, but we are having trouble with our larger reports such as this one.  Unfortunately, we can't seem to generate the aforemention report through the web service API. The following error occurs roughly 30-35 minutes into the generation/export:

Exception Message: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a receive.

The web service call is something I'm sure you all have seen before:  

    data = rs.Render(this.ReportPath, this.ExportFormat, null, deviceInfo,
       selectedParameters, null, null, out encoding, out mimeType, out usedParameters, 
       out warnings, out streamIds);

The odd thing is that this report will run/render/export if the report is run directly on the reporting server using the report manager. The proc that produces the data for the report runs for about 5 minutes. The report renders in SSRS native format in the browser/viewer after about 12 minutes. Exporting to pdf through the browser/viewer in the report manager takes an additional 55 minutes. This works reliably and it produces a whopping 1.03gb pdf.

Here are some of the more obvious things I've tried to get the report working via the web service API:  

  - set the HttpRuntime ExecutionTimeout
    value to 3 hours on the report
    server
  - disabled http keep alives on the report server
  - increased the script timeout on the report server
  - set the report to never time out on the server
  - set the report timeout to several hours on the client call  

From the tweaks I have tried, I am fairly comfortable saying that any timeout issues have been eliminated. 

Based off of my research of the error message, I believe that the web service API does not send chunked responses by default. This means that it tries to send all 1.3gb over the wire in one response. At a certain point, IIS throws in the towel. Unfortunately the API abstracts away web service configuration so I can't seem to find a way to enable response chunking. 

1. Does anyone know of anyway to reduce/optimize the PDF export phase and or the size of the PDF without lowering the total page count?
2. Is there a way to turn on response chunking for SSRS?
3. Does anyone else have any other theories as to why this runs on the server but not through the API?##C##<reporting-services><sqlreportingservices>##C##@$R$@

**Is the Single Responsibility Principle *really* a rule of OOP?**

My understanding of the definition of Object Orientated Programming is "a paradigm where objects and their behaviour are used to create software". This includes the following techniques: Encapsulation, Polymorphism & Inheritance.

Now don't get me wrong - I believe SRP to be the key to most good OO designs, but I feel there are cases where this principle can and should be broken (just like database normalization rules). I aggressively push the benefits of SRP, and the great majority of my code follows this principle. 

*But, is it a rule, and thus implies that it shouldn't be broken?*

I recently had a desire to visualize the relationship between [objects][1] in the [Nagios][2] configuration and I realized I didn't know how to do it properly and moved on to something more important.  I was reading the responses to [this thread][3] and realized this is something software developers must do a lot.

So this is probably a soft-pitch question, but what is the proper method for documenting object relationships in Visio?  Is there a better template to use?  What stencil collection is the proper stencil in?

In my probably naive view I imagine an object being a large box with a single "reception" connector and containing multiple smaller boxes, each of which represents an object member and having its own connector.  So, each object member field would connect out to the "reception" connector on the object of the member's type.  In and of itself those objects are fairly easy to build.  The problem I ran into is that the connector lines didn't respect the objects and ran over the top of them, making an awful, unusable mess.

Thanks for any pointers.

And I'm not talking using .NET with a Mono or Wine virtual platform running beneath.

Our company has about 20 developers all running Windows XP/Vista and developing primarily for Linux & Solaris.  Until recently we all logged into a main Linux server and modified/built code the good old fashioned way: Emacs, Vi, dtpad - take your pick.  Then someone said, "hey - we're living in the Dark Ages, we should be using an IDE".

So we tried out a few and decided that Visual Studio was the only one that would meet our performance needs (yes, I'm sure that IDE X is a very nice IDE, but we chose VS).

The problem is, how do you setup your environment to have the files available locally to VS, but also available to a build server?  We settled with writing a Visual Studio plugin - it writes our files locally and to the build server whenever we hit "Save" and we have a bit fat "sync" button that we can push when our files change on the server side (for when we update to the latest files from our source control server).  

The plugin also uses Visual Studio's external build system feature that ultimately just ssh's into the build server and calls our local "make" utility (which is Boost Build v2 - has great dependency checking, but is *really* slow to start as a result i.e. 30-60 seconds to begin).  The results are piped back into Visual Studio so the developer can click on the error and be taken to the appropriate line of code (quite slick actually).  The build server uses GCC and cross-compiles all of our Solaris builds.

But even after we've done all this, I can't help but sigh whenever I start to write code in Visual Studio.  I click a file, start typing, and VS chugs to catch up with me.

Is there anything more annoying than having to stop and wait for your tools?  Are the benefits worth the frustration?

Thoughts, stories, help?

I'm wondering if the effort in adding the extra OS configurations to the testing matrix is worth the effort. Is there any metrics available that state the percentage of users that could possibly benefit from the client profile?

Granted, I would imagine that Windows XP SP2 users without the .NET Framework installed would be a large amount of people.

I see that there's a *.Data.Configuration (or something close to this ... don't recall off the top of my head) assembly but am finding not much on the interwebs.  Complicating matters is the fact that the API help is broken on Vista.

Now, I found this work-around:

    Configuration cfg = ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(ConfigurationUserLevel.None);
    ConnectionStringSettings connection = new ConnectionStringSettings();
    connection.Name = "Runtime Connection";
    connection.ProviderName = "System.Data.OleDb";
    connection.ConnectionString = "myconstring";
    cfg.ConnectionStrings.ConnectionStrings.Add(connection);
    cfg.Save(ConfigurationSaveMode.Modified);

    ConfigurationManager.RefreshSection("connectionStrings");
    var runtimeCon = DatabaseFactory.CreateDatabase("Runtime Connection");

And although it gives me what I want, it permanently edits the App.config. Sure I can go back and delete the changes, but I'd rather not go through this hassle.

Then Mr. Manager takes this oh-so-useful information and builds a [burn-down chart][1]. This then allows us to track how 'complete' we are in the overall scope of things. It also allows us to measure our velocity (essentially How Fast We Get Things Done).

I've noticed that some people complete their tasks well under the original estimate (which makes us look good) and some people complete their tasks over the original estimate (which makes us look bad). 

While this measures how quickly people finish tasks it doesn't measure how well. It really gives you no solid indication of developer performance.

Neither does lines of code (you don't want devs to be overly verbose).

Neither does bugs raised (you are now basing the performance of a developer on the performance of a tester; they could not raise enough or raise too many).

So how would you go about measuring developer performance?

This is helpful because the product is part of the basic work environment of most of our users.
This feature was implemented not so long ago and for a while all was well, but when we started testing this feature on Vista the product started behaving really weird on startup. Specifically, our product makes use of another product (lets call it X) that it launches whenever it needs its services. The actual problem is that whenever X is launched immediately after log-on, it crashes or reports critical errors related to disk access (this happens even when X is launched directly - not through our product).

This happens whenever we run our product by registering it in the "Run" key in the registry or place a shortcut to it in the "Startup" folder inside the "Start Menu", even when we put a delay of ~20 seconds before actually starting to run. When we changed the delay to 70 seconds, all is well.

We tried to reproduce the problem by launching our product manually immediately after logon (by double-clicking on a shortcut placed on the desktop) but to no avail.

Now how is it possible that applications that run normally a minute after logon report such hard errors when starting immediately after logon?##C##<windows-vista>##C##@$R$@

[Son of Suckerfish][1] seems like the way to go, but I don't like the way it just disappears the second you move the mouse away, as users with co-ordination difficulties will have a nightmare navigating the site (or just not bother, but since it's a corporate site there are some who will probably _have_ to use whatever I implement).

Neat features that I've not even thought about needing are welcome, but the two main elements I'm looking for are:

 1. Multi-level using a nested UL/LI structure
 2. Small (possibly configurable?) delay before disappearing when the menu is "mouseout"-ed, even if it is provided by some extra JavaScript.

**Is there a way in PHP to overwrite a method declared by one interface in an interface extending that interface?**

*The "Example":*  
I'm probably doing something wrong, but here is what I have:

    interface iVendor{
     public function __construct($vendors_no = null);
     public function getName();
     public function getVendors_no();
     public function getZip();
     public function getCountryCode();
     public function setName($name);
     public function setVendors_no($vendors_no);
     public function setZip($zip);
     public function setCountryCode($countryCode);
    }

    interface iShipper extends iVendor{
     public function __construct($vendors_no = null, $shipment = null);
     public function getTransitTime($shipment = null);
     public function getTransitCost($shipment = null);
     public function getCurrentShipment();
     public function setCurrentShipment($shipment);
     public function getStatus($shipment = null);
    }

Normally in PHP, when you extend something, you can overwrite any method contained therein (right?). However, when one interface extends another, it won't let you. Unless I'm thinking about this wrong... When I implement the iShipper interface, I don't have to make the Shipper object extend the Vendor object (that implements the iVendor interface). I just say:

    class FedEx implements iShipper{}

and make FedEx implement all of the methods from iVendor and iShipper. However, I need the __construct functions in iVendor and iShipper to be unique. I know I could take out the $shipment = null, but then it wouldn't be as convenient to create Shippers (by just passing in the vendors_no and the shipment while instantiating).

Anyone know how to make this work? My fallback is to have to set the shipment by calling $shipper->setShipment($shipment); on the Shipper after I instantiate it, but I'm hoping for a way to get around having to do that...


*A little more explanation for the curious:*  
*The FedEx Object has methods that go to the FedEx site (using cURL) and gets an estimate for the Shipment in question. I have a UPS Object, a BAXGlobal Object, a Conway Object, etc. Each one has COMPLETELY different methods for actually getting the shipping estimate, but all the system needs to know is that they are a "shipper" and that the methods listed in the interface are callable on them (so it can treat them all exactly the same, and loop through them in a "shippers" array calling getTransitX() to find the best shipper for a shipment).*  
  
*Each "Shipper" is also a "Vendor" though, and is treated as such in other parts of the system (getting and putting in the DB, etc. Our data design is a pile of crap, so FedEx is stored right alongside companies like Dunder Mifflin in the "Vendors" table, which means it gets to have all the properties of every other Vendor, but needs the extra properties and methods supplied by iShipper).*##C##<php><oop><interface><extends>##C##@$R$@

One of the things I've asked a lot about on this site is [LINQ][1]. The questions I've asked have been wide and varied and often don't have much context behind them. So in an attempt to consolidate the knowledge I've acquired on Linq I'm posting this question with a view to maintaining and updating it with additional information as I continue to learn about LINQ. 

I also hope that it will prove to be a useful resource for other people wanting to learn about LINQ.

## What is LINQ?
From [MSDN][2]:

> The LINQ Project is a codename for a
> set of extensions to the .NET
> Framework that encompass
> language-integrated query, set, and
> transform operations. It extends C#
> and Visual Basic with native language
> syntax for queries and provides class
> libraries to take advantage of these
> capabilities.

What this means is that LINQ provides a standard way to query a variety of datasources using a common syntax. 

## What flavours of LINQ are there?
Currently there are a few different LINQ providers:

[Linq to Objects][3] which allows you to execute queries on any IEnumerable object.  
[Linq to SQL][4] which allows you to execute queries against a database in an object oriented manner.  
[Linq to XML][5] which allows you to query, load, validate, serialize and manipulate XML documents.

##What are the benefits?

 - Standardized way to query multiple datasources
 - Compile time safety of queries
 - Optimized way to perform set based operations on in memory objects
 - Ability to debug queries

##So what can I do with LINQ?
[Chook][6] provides a way to [output CSV files][7]  
[Jeff][8] shows how to [remove duplicates from an array][9]  
Bob gets a [distinct ordered list from a datatable][10]
[Marxidad][11] shows how to [sort an array][12]

##Where to start?
A summary of links from [GateKiller's question][13]  are below:  
Scott Guthrie provides an [intro to Linq on his blog][14]  
An overview of [LINQ on MSDN][15]

The web service implements the WS-Security stack (either WSE 2 or WSE 3, it's not clear from the information I have).  

The information that I received from the service provider included WSDL, a policyCache.config file, some sample C# code, and a sample application that can successfully call the service.

This isn't as useful as it sounds because it's not clear how I'm supposed to use this information to write a Java client.  If the web service request isn't signed according to the policy then it is rejected by the service.  I'm trying to use Apache Axis2 and I can't find any instructions on how I'm supposed to use the policyCahce.config file and the WSDL to generate a client.

There are several examples that I have found on the Web but in all cases the authors of the examples had control of both the service and the client and so were able to make tweaks on both sides in order to get it to work.  I'm not in that position.

A transport-level error has occurred when sending the request to the server.

According to my research, this is something that "just happens" and not much can be done to prevent it.  It does not happen as a result of a bad query, and generally cannot be duplicated.  It just crops up maybe once every few days in a busy OLTP system when the TCP connection to the database goes bad for some reason.

I am forced to detect this error by parsing the exception message, and then retrying the entire operation from scratch, to include using a new connection.  None of that is pretty.

My array and class:

    var tPoints = [];    
    function tPoint(name) {
         var id = name;
         var points = [];

         ...
         this.getHeadPoint = function() { return points[pointsCount-1]; }
        }

tPoint holds an array of [GLatLng][2] points. I want to write a function to return a [GLatLngBounds][3] object which is extended from the current map bounds to show all the HeadPoints.

Heres what I have so far..

    function getBounds() {
     var mBound = map.getBounds();
     for (var i = 0; i < tPoints.lenght; i++) {
      alert(mBound.getSouthWest().lat() + "," + mBound.getSouthWest().lng());
      alert(mBound.getNorthEast().lat() + "," + mBound.getNorthEast().lng());
             currPoint = trackMarkers[i].getHeadPoint();        
             if (!mBound.containsLatLng(currPoint)) {
                 mBound.extend(currPoint);
             }
         }
     return mBound;
    }

Which returns these values for the alert. (Generally over the US)<br />
"19.64258,NaN"<br />
"52.69636,NaN"<br />
"i=0"<br />
"19.64258,NaN"<br />
"52.69636,-117.20701"<br />
"i=1"<br />

I don't know why I am getting NaN back.
When I use the bounds to get a zoom level I think the NaN value is causing the map.getBoundsZoomLevel(bounds) to return 0 which is incorrect. Am I using [GLatLngBounds][3] incorrectly?

I love it, but there is one tiny thing that is annoying to me about this feature: *the window stays around after releasing the ctrl key*. When doing an alt-tab in windows, you can hit tab to get to the item you want (while still holding down the alt key), and then when you find what you want, *lifting up* on the alt key selects that item.

I wish VS 2008 would do the same. For me, when I lift off of ctrl, the window is still there. I have to hit enter to actually select the item. I find this annoying.

Does anyone know how to make VS 2008 dismiss the window on the *release* of the ctrl key? Thanks!##C##<vs2008><ide>##C##@$R$@

Related to this very specific sort of application a I two questions:

- Experienced guys in Delphi and/or COM, do you have any workrounds to work with the buggy TLB interface ? 
Some of the bugs are: IDE crashing during edition of a large TLB, lost of methods IDs, TLB corruption, etc.
Here, we haven't found any good solution. Actually we tried do upgrade do the new 2007 version. But the new IDE TLB interface has the same bugs that we found before.

- How do you control TLBs versions ? The TLB file is in a binary format and conflict resolutions are very hard to do. We tried to do it exporting the interfaces descriptions to IDL and commiting into CVS, but we didn't found any good way to generate TLBs from IDL using Delphi. Additionaly, the MIDL tool provided by Microsoft, didn't parse correctly the IDL files that we exported from delphi.

Thanks in advance,

As a quick-and-dirty solution I have created 2 separate tasks, compiling portions of the project in each. I really don't think this solution will hold as more classes are added in the future, and I don't want to be adding new compile tasks every time we hit the "compile limit".

We have one solution with multiple applications, multiple dependencies.  We're on SourceSafe currently and are planning to move to subversion but are finding it difficult to organize our source the right way.

 - Example solution
  - App1
  - App2
  - BizObjects
  - DataAccess
  - CustomControls

 - Dependencies 
  - BizObjects->DataAccess
  - App1->CustomControls
  - App1->BizObjects 
  - App1->DataAccess
  - App2->CustomControls
  - App2->BizObjects

We also have a configuration management system which deploys (via copy from database) depending on which workload the operator is working.  We mark an application "release" with a version and to that release we add multiple file dependencies.  Bear in mind the solution we have in place now is an attempt to band-aid the old (windows 3.1 developed) solution to work with .NET file/dependency structure.

In the case of App1 we have App1.exe, BizObjects.dll, DataAccess.dll, and CustomControls.dll.
We have the same set of dependencies for App2 due to BizObjects referencing DataAccess -- but this is defined manually.  We don't have a system in place to identify the dependency tree.  

Each of the dependencies for a "release" is a file and version id.  And the same application could contain different versions for each file for a different workload.

1. Where in the world have we gone wrong? Did we go wrong?
2. How can we structure a svn source tree to accommodate the deployment requirements?
 - or
3. how can we re-structure the code the better support a deployment strategy which makes sense for our setup?

We have an old and over-engineered solution to (it would seem) a relatively simple problem.  Can anyone steer me/us in the right direction?

edit: I read this(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3667/what-is-your-favorite-web-app-deployment-workflow-with-svn) question and remembered we also have the same dev/test/prod areas which the code must move through.

The above code works just fine when server returns a "non-chunked" response.

The only way I've been able to get it to work is to use HTTP/1.0 for the initial request (instead of HTTP/1.1, the default) but this seems like a lame work-around.

I know from previous encounters with Boost (1.33.1) that self compiling is a miserable experience: A lot of time wasted to get it started and then a hoard of errors passes across your screen faster than you can read, so what you are left with is an uneasy feeling that something is broken but you don't quite know what.

<table>
<tr><th>Category</th><th>Revenue</th><th>Yearh</th><th>Month</th></tr>
<tr><td>Bikes</td><td>10 000</td><td>2008</td><td>1</td>
<tr><td>Bikes</td><td>12 000</td><td>2008</td><td>2</td>
<tr><td>Bikes</td><td>12 000</td><td>2008</td><td>3</td>

<tr><td>Bikes</td><td>11 500</td><td>2007</td><td>3</td>
<tr><td>Bikes</td><td>15 400</td><td>2007</td><td>4</td>
</table>
<br/>
... And so forth

The view has a product  category, a revenue, a year and a month. I want to create a report comparing 2007 and 2008, showing 0 for the months with no sales. So the report should look something like this:

<table>
<tr><th>Category</th><th>Month</th><th>Revenue This Year</th><th>Revenue Last Year</th></tr>
<tr><td>Bikes</td><td>1</td><td>10 000</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bikes</td><td>2</td><td>12 000</td><td>11 000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bikes</td><td>3</td><td>12 000</td><td>11 500</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bikes</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>15 400</td></tr>
</table>
<br/>
The key thing to notice is how month 1 only has sales in 2008, and therefore is 0 for 2007. Also, month 4 only has no sales in 2008, hence the 0, while it has sales in 2007 and still show up.

Also, the report is actually for financial year - so I would love to have empty columns with 0 in both if there was no sales in say month 5 for either 2007 or 2008.

The query I got looks something like this:

    SELECT 
        SP1.Program,
        SP1.Year,
        SP1.Month,
        SP1.TotalRevenue,
        IsNull(SP2.TotalRevenue, 0) AS LastYearTotalRevenue
    
    FROM PVMonthlyStatusReport AS SP1 
         LEFT OUTER JOIN PVMonthlyStatusReport AS SP2 ON 
                    SP1.Program = SP2.Program AND 
                    SP2.Year = SP1.Year - 1 AND 
                    SP1.Month = SP2.Month
    WHERE 
        SP1.Program = 'Bikes' AND
        SP1.Category = @Category AND 
        (SP1.Year >= @FinancialYear AND SP1.Year <= @FinancialYear + 1) AND
        ((SP1.Year = @FinancialYear AND SP1.Month > 6) OR 
         (SP1.Year = @FinancialYear + 1 AND SP1.Month <= 6))
    
    ORDER BY SP1.Year, SP1.Month

The problem with this query is that it would not return the fourth row in my example data above, since we didn't have any sales in 2008, but we actually  did in 2007.

This is probably a common query/problem, but my SQL is rusty after doing front-end development for so long. Any help is greatly appreciated!

The resources are--me, who has done Web content maintenance (putting content into HTML and ColdFusion templates via a gatekeeper to the site itself; doing simple HTML and XML coding); a serious Web developer who does database programming, ColdFusion, etc., and talks way over the heads of the rest of us; two designers who use Dreamweaver; the guy who created the original (and now badly broken) site in Front Page and wants to use Expression Web; and assorted other club members who are even less technically inclined.

What we need up first is some text and graphics (a gorgeous design has been created in Dreamweaver), some links (including to existing PDF newsletters for download), and maybe hooking up an existing Blogspot blog. Later (or earlier if it's not hard), we may add mouseover menus to the links, a gallery, a calendar, a few Mapquest hotlinks, and so on.

My question--First, is there any real problem with sticking with HTML and jpegs for the initial site? Second, for the "later" part of the site development, what's the simplest we can go with? Third, are there costs in doing this the simple way that will make us regret it down the road? Also, is there a good site/resource where I can learn more about this from a newbie perspective?

However, all the win32 API experience in the world may not directly apply to linux development.

This is a multi-part question really. What are the common specializations within computer programming and software development. Which of these specializations have more long-term value, both as a foundation for other specializations and/or as marketable skills. Which skill sets complement each other.

The `Dispatcher` class, which is used by `DispatcherObject`, has the same attribute attached to `CheckAccess()` and `VerifyAccess()`.

I don't believe that the application of that attribute is random (or a joke), so my question is: why is it there? Should those methods not be called directly? Then why aren't they `protected` (or `internal`, like some of the most useful methods in the WPF)?##C##<.net><intellisense>##C##@$R$@

Hi All,  
OK, further into my adventures with custom controls...

In summary, here is that I have learned of three main "classes" of custom controls. Please feel free to correct me if any of this is wrong!  

1. **UserControls** - Which inherit from _UserControl_ and are contained within an _ASCX_ file. These are pretty limited in what they can do, but are a quick and light way to get some UI commonality with designer support.
2. **Custom Composite Controls** - These are controls that inherit from _WebControl_ where you add pre-existing controls to the control within the _CreateChildControls_ method. This provides great flexibility, but lack of designer support without additional coding. They are highly portable though since they can be compiled into a DLL.
3. **Custom Rendered Controls** - Similar to Custom Composite Controls, these are added to a Web Control Library project. The rendering of the control is completely controlled by the programmer by overriding the _Render_ method.

##My Thoughts..
OK, so while playing with custom composites, I found the following:

* You have little/no control over the HTML output making it difficult to "debug".
* The _CreateChildControls_ (and subsequent methods) can get real busy with _Controls.Add(myControl)_ everywhere.
* I found rendering tables (be it for layout or content) to be considerably awkward.

##The Question(s)..
So, I admit, I am new to this so I could be way off-base with some of my points noted above..

* Do you use Composites?
* Do you have any neat tricks to control the HTML output?
* Do you just say "to hell with it" and go ahead and create a custom rendered control?

**Its something I am keen to get really firm in my mind since I know how much _good_ control development can cut overall development time.**

The problem is that CryptEncrypt can produce NULL's in the output, meaning that when it's stored in the database, the string manipulations will at some point truncate the ciphertext.

Ideally we'd like to use an algo that will produce cyphertext that doesn't contain NULLs as that will cause the least amount of change to the existing databases (changing a column from string to binary and code to deal with binary instead of strings) and just decrypt existing data and re-encrypt with the new algo at database upgrade time.

The algorithm doesn't need to be the most secure, as the database is already in a reasonably secure environment (not an open network / teh interwebs) but does need to bebetter than ROT13 (which I can almost decrypt in my head now!)

Since the web-viewer built into VisualSVN server is a minimalistic subversion browser, I'd like to install [WebSVN](http://websvn.tigris.org/) on top of my repositories.

The problem, however, is that I can't seem to get authentication to work. Ideally I'd like my current repository authentication as specified in VisualSVN to work with WebSVN, so that though I see all the repository names in WebSVN, I can't actually browse into them without the right credentials.

There I found some php functions I could tack onto one of the php files in WebSVN. I followed the modifications there, but all I succeeded in doing was make WebSVN ask me for a username and password and no matter what I input, it won't let me in.

OK, following on from my other question on [ASP.NET Web Service Results, Proxy Classes and Type Conversion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6681/aspnet-web-service-results-proxy-classes-and-type-conversion). I've come to a part in my project where I need to get my thinking cap on.

Basically, we have a large, complex custom object that needs to be returned from a Web Service and consumed in the client application.

Now, based on the previous discussion, we know this is going to then take the form of the proxy class(es) as the return type. To overcome this, we need to basically copy the properties from one to the other.

In this case, that is something that I would really, really, _really!_ like to avoid!

So, it got me thinking, **how else could we do this?**

My current thoughts are to enable the object for complete serialization to XML and then return the XML as a string from the Web Service. We then de-serialize at the client. This will mean a fair bit of attribute decorating, but at least the code at both endpoints will be light, namely by just using the .NET XML Serializer.

Obviously, each project is unique, so my question here is **not** so much **whether** assertions should be kept, **but in which cases** this is recommendable/not a good idea.

By assertion, I mean:

  - A run-time check that tests a condition which, when false, reveals a bug in the software.
  - A mechanism by which the program is halted (maybe after really minimal clean-up work).

I'm not necessarily talking about C or C++.

My own opinion is that if you're the programmer, but don't own the data (which is the case with most commercial desktop applications), you should keep them on, because a failing asssertion shows a bug, and you should not go on with a bug, with the risk of corrupting the user's data. This forces you to test strongly before you ship, and makes bugs more visible, thus easier to spot and fix.

What's your opinion/experience?

The problem is that I don't want to be using up the bandwidth on the 10.16.x.x network for internet traffic, etc (this network is basically only for internal stuff, though it does have internet access) so I would like the system to use the 10.17.x.x connection for anything that is external to the LAN (and for anything on 10.17.x.x of course, and to only use the 10.16.x.x connection for things that are on *that* specific LAN.

I've tried looking into the windows "route" command but it's fairly confusing and won't seem to let me delete routes tha tI believe are interfering with what I want it to do.  Is there a better way of doing this?  Any good software for segmenting your LAN access?##C##<networking><windows-server-2003>##C##@$R$@

I can't seem to remove these warnings whatever I do. When I double click on them it takes me to a part of my code that uses OdbcParameters - any when I try a test project with all the rest of my stuff but no OdbcParameters it doesn't give the warnings.

Any idea how I can get rid of these warnings? They're making real warnings from code I've actually written hard to see - and it just gives me a horrible feeling knowing my app has 104 warnings!

While there are some AppleScript hooks, it looks like the best approach is to manipulate the underlying XML data.

This turns out to be pretty ugly because (for example) page breaks are stored in XML. So for example, you have something like:

    ... we hold these truths to be self evident, that </page>
    <page>all men are created equal, and are ...

So if you want to add or remove text, you have to move the start/end tags around based on the size of the text on the page. This is pretty impossible without computing the number of words a page can hold, which seems wildly inelegant.

Anybody have any thoughts on this?

Also, I have the < and > buttons to move the current selection from one list to the other (in addition to double clicking, which works fine).

Is it possible in WPF to set up a style/trigger to enable or disable the move buttons depending on anything being selected in either ListBox? SelectedItems is on the left side, so the < button will move the selected AvailableItems to that list. However, if no items are selected (AvailableItems.SelectedIndex == -1), I want this button to be disabled (IsEnabled == false) - and the other way around for the other list/button.

Is this possible to do directly in XAML, or do I need to create complex logic in the codebehind to handle it?

I'm using a `URLLoader` to load a XML file, and upon `Event.COMPLETE` creating a new XML object. 75% of the time this work fine, and every now and again I get this type of exception:

    TypeError: Error #1085: The element type "link" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</link>".


We think the problem is that The XML is large, and perhaps the `Event.COMPLETE` event is fired before the XML is actually downloaded from the `URLLoader`. The only solution we have come up with is to set off a timer upon the Event, and essentially "wait a few seconds" before beginning to parse the data. Surely this can't be the best way to do this.

Yesterday I was informed that the first line of text on my website appeared upside down in Internet Explorer 6 without flash player. I'm pretty sure that assessment was wrong, owing to no flash player = no sIFR. But I'm getting some odd behavior on my pages, at least in IE 6, 7 and 8. I only really wanted to use sIFR because my fonts looked crummy on my computer in Firefox. 

My question is: if you use sIFR, when do you use sIFR? In which cases do you disable sIFR? When is it better to just use the browser font?

Back a few years ago I was working with oracle databases and was using primarily TOAD with a little bit of MS Access as my tools of choice to prototype the queries I was using in my applications.  I really loved TOAD in that it was super intuitive and really easy to use and I'm hoping to find something similar for MS SQL Server.

I thought I'd try to accomplish it using javascript and not CSS in an effort to keep the requests for image files to a minimum (yes, I know that it's possible to combine all required rounded corner shapes into one image) and I also wanted to be able to change the background color pretty much on the fly.

I already utilize jQuery so I looked at the excellent [rounded corners plugin][1] and it worked like a charm in every browser I tried. Being a developer however I noticed the opportunity to make it a bit more efficient. The script already includes code for detecting if the current browser supports webkit rounded corners (safari based browsers). If so it uses raw CSS instead of creating layers of divs.

I thought that it would be awesome if the same kind of check could be performed to see if the browser supports the Gecko-specific -moz-border-radius-* properties and if so utilize them.

The check for webkit support looks like this:

    var webkitAvailable = false;  
    try {  
        webkitAvailable = (document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(this[0], null)['-webkit-border-radius'] != undefined);
    } 
    catch(err) {}

That, however, did not work for -moz-border-radius so I started checking for alternatives.

My fallback solution is of course to use browser detection but that's far from recommended practice ofcourse.

My best solution yet is as follows.

    var mozborderAvailable = false;
    try {
        var o = jQuery('<div>').css('-moz-border-radius', '1px');
        mozborderAvailable = $(o).css('-moz-border-radius-topleft') == '1px';
        o = null;
    } catch(err) {}

Is there any javascript/CSS guru out there that have a better solution?

That code, in an of itself, works OK, but the other server returns a response from it's XML parser stating:

I looked that error up and this is normally caused by whitespace before the XML, but I made sure that the XML file itself has no whitespace and the trim() should clear that up anyway. I did a TCPDump on the connection while I ran the code and this is what is sent out:

However, on the staging version of the same server, there's a linked server that points to the production database. Both the staging server and the linked server have the same schema.

I've been reassured that I should expect to be able to connect to the live server before we go live. Unfortunately, I've reached a point in my development where I need more than the token sample records that are currently in the staging database. So, I was hoping to connect to the linked server.

Thus far in my development against this schema has been against the staging server itself, using Subsonic objects. That all works fine.

I can connect via SQL Server Management Studio to that linked server and execute my queries directly. I can also execute 'manual" queries in C# against the linked server by having my connection string hook up to the staging server and running my queries as 

SELECT * FROM OpenQuery([LINKEDSERVER],'QUERY')

However, the Subsonic objects are what's enabling me to bring this project in on time and under budget, so I'm not looking to do straight queries in my code.

What I'm looking for is whether there's a way to state the connection string to the linked server. I've looked at lots of forum entries, etc. on the topic and most of the answers seem to completely gloss over the "linked server" portion of the question, focusing on basic connection string syntax.

I have three basic tables: Card, Property, and CardProperty. Since cards do not have the same properties, and often multiple values for the same property, I decided to use the union table approach to store data instead of having a really big column structure in my card table.

The property table is a basic keyword/value type table. So you have the keyword ATK and the value assigned to it. There is another property called SpecialType which a card can have multiple values for, such as "Sycnro" and "DARK"

What I'd like to do is create a view or stored procedure that gives me the Card Id, Card Name, and all the property keywords assigned to the card as columns and their values in the ResultSet for a card specified. So ideally I'd have a result set like:

    ID  NAME                   SPECIALTYPE
    1   Red Dragon Archfiend   Synchro
    1   Red Dragon Archfiend   DARK
    1   Red Dragon Archfiend   Effect

and I could tally my results that way.

I guess even slicker would be to simply concatenate the properties together based on their keyword, so I could generate a ResultSet like:

    1  Red Dragon Archfiend   Synchro/DARK/Effect

Whilst I appreciate PRINCE2 is a great method of running projects, and, we've had a lot of success with it, I feel it's fairly high level for the nitty-gritty of building software.

Is it unheard of to run an AGILE method such as SCRUM for the day to day building and deployment of code underneath, or, within the framework of PRINCE2?

Obviously we have a number of qualified, experienced PRINCE2 practitioners in the business so I'd never suggest replacing PRINCE2 with SCRUM, but I can still see the benefits of SCRUM.

Anyone any thoughts, in practice do the two contradict or complicate one another, does anyone have any personal success stories. What about other methodologies? Can we let PRINCE2 take care of the high-level stuff and then run another method for the nuts and bolts of developing?

Basically I want to fade the panel using a Fade effect in Actionscript.  I can get the fade to work fine, however the label of the combobox does not fade.  I had this same issue with buttons and found that their fonts needed to be embedded.  No problem.  I embedded the font that I was using and the buttons' labels faded correctly.  I've tried a similar approach to the combobox, but it does not fade the selected item label.

Here is what I've done so far:
Embed code for the font at the top of my MXML in script:

    [Embed("assets/trebuc.ttf", fontName="TrebuchetMS")]
    public var trebuchetMSFont:Class;
In my init function

    //register the font.
    Font.registerFont(trebuchetMSFont);

The combobox's mxml:

    <mx:ComboBox id="FilterFields" styleName="FilterDropdown" 
      left="10" right="10" top="10"
      fontSize="14">
      <mx:itemRenderer>
        <mx:Component>
          <mx:Label fontSize="10" />
        </mx:Component>
      </mx:itemRenderer>
    </mx:ComboBox>

And a style that I wrote to get the fonts applied to the combobox:

    .FilterDropdown
    {
      embedFonts: true;
      fontFamily: TrebuchetMS;
      fontWeight: normal;
      fontSize: 12; 
    }

The reason I had to write a style instead of placing it in the "FontFamily" attribute was that the style made all the text on the combobox the correct font where the "FontFamily" attribute only made the items in the dropdown use the correct font.##C##<flex><actionscript-3>##C##@$R$@

As Tundey pointed out in his answer to my last question, you can bind nearly everything about a windows forms control to ApplicationSettings pretty effortlessly. So is there really no way to do this with form Size? [This tutorial](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/UserSettings.aspx) says you need to handle Size explicitly so you can save RestoreBounds instead of size if the window is maximized or minimized. However, I hoped I could just use a property like:

    public Size RestoreSize
    {
        get
        {
            if (WindowState == FormWindowState.Normal)
            {
                return Size;
            }
            else
            {
                return RestoreBounds.Size;
            }
        }
        set
        {
            ...
        }
    }

But I can't see a way to bind this in the designer (Size is notably missing from the PropertyBinding list).##C##<c#><.net-2.0><visual-studio><databindings>##C##@$R$@

I am not convinced that entity objects should exist.

By entity objects I mean the typical things we tend to build for our applications, like "Person", "Account", "Order", etc.

My current design philosophy is this:

  - All database access must be accomplished via stored procedures.
  - Whenever you need data, call a stored procedure and iterate over a SqlDataReader or the rows in a DataTable

(Note: I have also built enterprise applications with J2EE, java folks please substitute the equvalent for my .NET examples)

I am not anti-OO.  I write lots of classes for different purposes, just not entities.  I will admit that a large portion of the classes I write are static helper classes.

I am not building toys.  I'm talking about large, high volume transactional applications deployed across multiple machines.  Web applications, windows services, web services, b2b interaction, you name it.

I have used OR Mappers.  I have written a few.  I have used the J2EE stack, CSLA, and a few other equivalents.  I have not only used them but actively developed and maintained these applications in production environments.

I have come to the battle-tested conclusion that entity objects are getting in our way, and our lives would be *so* much easier without them.

Consider this simple example: you get a support call about a certain page in your application that is not working correctly, maybe one of the fields is not being persisted like it should be.  With my model, the developer assigned to find the problem opens *exactly 3 files*.  An ASPX, an ASPX.CS and a SQL file with the stored procedure.  The problem, which might be a missing parameter to the stored procedure call, takes minutes to solve.  But with any entity model, you will invariably fire up the debugger, start stepping through code, and you may end up with 15-20 files open in Visual Studio.  By the time you step down to the bottom of the stack, you forgot where you started.  We can only keep so many things in our heads at one time.  Software is incredibly complex without adding any unnecessary layers.

Development complexity and troubleshooting are just one side of my gripe.

Now let's talk about scalability.

Do developers realize that each and every time they write or modify any code that interacts with the database, they need to do a throrough analysis of the exact impact on the database?  And not just the development copy, I mean a mimic of production, so you can see that the additional column you now require for your object just invalidated the current query plan and a report that was running in 1 second will now take 2 minutes, just because you added a single column to the select list?  And it turns out that the index you now require is so big that the DBA is going to have to modify the physical layout of your files?

If you let people get too far away from the physical data store with an abstraction, they will create havoc with an application that needs to scale.

I am not a zealot.  I can be convinced if I am wrong, and maybe I am, since there is such a strong push towards Linq to Sql, ADO.NET EF, Hibernate, J2EE, etc.  Please think through your responses, if I am missing something I really want to know what it is, and why I should change my thinking.##C##<sql><database><orm><entities>##C##@$R$@

In particular, is there a way to read Unicode text from a label (I assume it's a normal Windows label control) from an external Win32 app that was written by a 3rd party? The text is visible, but not selectable by mouse in the UI.

I assume there is some accessibility API (e.g. meant for screen readers) that allows this. 

Edit: Currently looking into using something like the [Managed Spy App][1] but would still appreciate any other leads.

We ahve initially searched many tools but none of them was right for us. 

By using the tool you can record test-cases and group them together to test-suites. For every test-suite there is generated an application, which launches the application-under-test and simulates user-input.

In general the tool works fine, but as we are using **window- handles** for simulation user input, you can't do very many things. For example it is impossible for us to get the name of a control (we just get the caption). 

Another problem using window- handles is checking for a change. At the moment we simulate a click on a control and depending on the result we know if the application has gone to the next step.

Is there any other (simpler) way for doing such things (for example the message queue or anything else)?

In short it loads a xml with markup that defines the blocks of the site, their content and the styling of these (very similar to html), handles the loading of assets and such.

Now I'm rather pleased with how this is turning out, and I've been itching to release some of my code for public use (and scrutiny). I'm also reasonably sure that it fills a void for quick and easy construction of sites (or parts of them).

{

  web = new mywebservice();

}

public void CallWebservice()
{

  web.call();

The second approach likes me very much but sometimes it times out and I had to start the application again, the first one I think it brings overhead and it is not very efficient, in fact, sometimes the first call returns a WebException - ConnectFailure (I don't know why). 

I found an article ([Web Service Woes (A light at the end of the tunnel?)][1]) that exceeds the time out turning the KeepAlive property to false in the overriden function GetWebRequest, here's is the code:

Protected Overrides Function GetWebRequest(ByVal uri As System.Uri) As System.Net.WebRequest

  Dim webRequest As Net.HttpWebRequest = CType(MyBase.GetWebRequest(uri), Net.HttpWebRequest)

  webRequest.KeepAlive = False

  Return webRequest

End Function

The question is, is it possible to extend forever the webservice time out and finally, how do you implement your webservices to handle this issue?

Unfortunately if a user is not currently logged in, or the machine is locked, then Max does not run correctly.

This can be solved for freshly booted machines by using a method such as TweakUI for automatic login. However when a user connects via Remote Desktop (to initiate a non-scheduled build, change a setting, whatever) then after the session ends the machine is left in a locked state with Max unable to run.

I'm looking for a way to configure windows (via fair means or foul) so either it does not lock when the remote session ends, or it "unlocks" itself a short while after. I'm aware of a method under XP where you can run a batchfile on the machine which kicks the remote user off, but this does not appear to work on Windows Server.

However, there are usually subtle differences. For instance, a field might be read-only once it's been added, and if that field is a DropDownList you no longer need that List in the ViewData.

So, should I create a view data class which contains all the information for both views, where, depending on the operation you're performing, certain properties will be null?

and on my Message control I had this:

I would think this would render the DisplayMessage correctly, however, null is being returned.  After a heavy dose of tinkering around, I finally created a "MessageData" class in order to strongly type my user control:

I realise that with <code>apt.conf</code> that you could set <code>chmod 600</code> (which it isn't by default on Ubuntu/Debian!) but on our system there are people who need root priveleges .I also realise that technically you cannot protect your password 100% against someone with root access but is there a way where you can at least not have it in plain text? Protecting passwords in <code>~/profile</code> is just as problematic.

I only ask since the other day, I entirely by accident discovered somebody elses password in this way when comparing configuration files across systems.

The app actually consists of 2 parts, one runs on Windows and interacts with a user and another is a linux part that runs from a LiveCD. User makes a choice of Windows drive letters and then a linux part performs actions with corresponding partitions. The problem is finding a match between a Windows drive letter (like C:) and a linux device name (like /dev/sda1). This is my current solution that I rate as ugly:

- store partitions information (i.e. drive letter, number of blocks, drive serial number etc.) in Windows in some pre-defined place (i.e. the root of the system partition).

- read a list of partitions from /proc/partitions. Get only those partitions that has major number for SCSI or IDE hard drives and minor number that identifies them as real partitions and not the whole disks.

- Try to mount each of them with either ntfs or vfat file systems. Check whether the mounted partition contains the information stored by Windows app.

- Upon finding the required information written by the Windows app make the actual match. For each partition found in /proc/partitions acquire drive serial number (via HDIO_GET_IDENTITY syscall), number of blocks (from /proc/partitions) and drive offset (/sys/blocks/drive_path/partition_name/start), compare this to the Windows information and if this matches - store a Windows drive letter along with a linux device name. 

There are a couple of problems in this scheme:

- This is ugly. Writing data in Windows and then reading it in Linux makes testing a nightmare.

- linux device major number is compared only with IDE or SCSI devices. This would probably fail, i.e. on USB or FireWire disks. It's possible to add these types of disks, but limiting the app to only known subset of possible devices seems to be rather bad idea.

- looks like HDIO_GET_IDENTITY works only on IDE and SATA drives.

- /sys/block hack may not work on other than IDE or SATA drives.

Any ideas on how to improve this schema? Perhaps there is another way to determine windows names without writing all the data in windows app?

P.S. The language of the app is C++. I can't change this.##C##<c++><linux><drive>##C##@$R$@

Currently: I have three arrays of regex, one for valid filenames, one for files missing an episode name, and one for valid paths.

Then, I loop though each valid-filename regex, if it matches, append it to a "valid" dict, if not, do the same with the missing-ep-name regexs, if it matches this I append it to an "invalid" dict with an error code (2:'missing epsiode name'), if it matches neither, it gets added to invalid with the 'malformed name' error code.

How could I write this system in a more expandable way?

The rules it needs to check would be..

- File is in the format `Show Name - [01x23] - Episode Name.avi` or `Show Name - [01xSpecial02] - Special Name.avi` or `Show Name - [01xExtra01] - Extra Name.avi`
- If filename is in the format `Show Name - [01x23].avi` display it a 'missing episode name' section of the output
- The path should be in the format `Show Name/season 2/the_file.avi` (where season 2 should be the correct season number in the filename)
- each `Show Name/season 1/` folder should contain "folder.jpg"

.any ideas? While I'm trying to check TV episodes, this concept/code should be able to apply to many things..

The only thought I had was a list of dicts in the format:

Google has this nice function call google.setOnLoadCallback(initialize); which works great. I'm not sure amq.js has something like this.

I need to write a stored procedure that returns how many jobs each person has at each stage.

So far I have this (simplified):

    DECLARE @ResultTable table 
    (
      StaffName nvarchar(100),
      Stage1Count int,
      Stage2Count int
    )

    INSERT INTO @ResultTable (StaffName, Stage1Count)
      SELECT StaffName, COUNT(*) FROM ViewJob
      WHERE InStage1 = 1
      GROUP BY StaffName

    INSERT INTO @ResultTable (StaffName, Stage2Count)
      SELECT StaffName, COUNT(*) FROM ViewJob
      WHERE InStage2 = 1
      GROUP BY StaffName
 
The problem with that is that the rows don't combine. So if a staff member has jobs in stage1 and stage2 there's two rows in @ResultTable. What I would really like to do is to update the row if one exists for the staff member and insert a new row if one doesn't exist.

Does anyone know how to do this, or can suggest a different approach?
I would really like to avoid using cursors to iterate on the list of users (but that's my fall back option).

Something that constantly frustrates me is that people don't want to learn any more than they need to about the programming languages they use every day.

Many programmers seem content to learn some pidgin sub-dialect, and stick with that. If they see a keyword or construct that they aren't familiar with, they'll complain that the code is "tricky."

What would you think of a civil engineer who shied away from calculus because it had "all those tricky math symbols?"

I'm not suggesting that we all need to become "language lawyers." But if you make your living as a programmer, and claim to be a competent user of language X, then I think at a minimum you should know the following:

- What are all the keywords of the language?
- What are all the valid syntactic forms?
- How are memory, files, and other operating system resources managed?
- Where is the official language specification and library reference for the language?

The last one is the one that really gets me. Many programmers seem to have no idea that there is a "specification" or "standard" for any particular language. I still talk to people who think that Microsoft invented C++, and that if a program doesn't compile under VC6, it's not a valid C++ program.

Programmers these days have it easy when it comes to obtaining specs. Newer languages like C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. all have their documentation available for free from the vendors' web sites. Older languages and platforms often have standards controlled by standards bodies that demand payment for specs, but even that shouldn't be a deterrent: the C++ standard is available from ISO for $30 (and why am I the only person I know who has a copy?).

Programming is hard enough even when you do know the language. If you don't, I don't see how you have a chance. 

What do the rest of you think?  Am I right, or should we all be content with the typical level of programming language expertise?##C##<language-features><language-agnostic><rant>##C##@$R$@

Basically, it will start with a description of traditional software development methologies, and the subsequent birth of agile methodologies, finishing with recommendations and a design of a flexible application architecture easily adaptable to the inherent changes in software construction.

My question is, what patterns and design practices would you recommend for such an architecture?
I'm interested in patterns that allow for maximization of class decoupling like dependency injection, high maintanability, and maximum abstraction from the specific problem.##C##<architecture><oop><design-patterns>##C##@$R$@

Part of this tool is another application (The Cruise Control Dashboard) that runs in its own Virtual Directory under my root application.

I wanted to limit access to this internal application by setting up Forms Authentication on it, and having a login form in the root application.

I put the following into the root applications web.config:


    <location path="ccnet">
      <system.web>
        <authentication mode="Forms">
            <forms loginUrl="/default.aspx" timeout="5000"/>
        </authentication>
        <authorization>
          <allow users="?"/>
          <deny users="?"/>
        </authorization>        
      </system.web>    
    </location>

However, the Forms Authentication does not appear to be working, it does not redirect back to the login page when I access that application directly.

I have a feeling I have the &lt;allow&gt; and &lt;deny&gt; tags set wrong. Can someone clarify?##C##<asp.net><authentication><cruisecontrol.net>##C##@$R$@

In my opinion it is:

 1. Overly complex, especially for use within web apps (all that threaded runtime stuff)
 2. Immature (ever worked with that horrible designer?)
 3. Anemic in its current feature set

Does anyone have a suggestion for a better .NET based workflow framework?  Specifically, I am looking for the following features:

 1. State machine based (mapping states to available actions)
 2. A focus on user permissions (controlling who has access to what actions)
 3. The ability to run workflows as timed background tasks (for example, to send out reminders for items that have been sitting in a certain state for x days)

That's really all I need. I don't need to be able to "drag and drop" any activities or visually design the flow. I am perfectly comfortable writing actual code once a particular action is triggered.##C##<asp.net><workflow>##C##@$R$@

    [WebService(Namespace = "http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing")]
    [WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)]
    [ToolboxItem(false)]
    public class ProvisioningService : WebService
    {
     [WebMethod]
     public XmlDocument ProcessMessage(XmlDocument message)
     {
      // ... do stuff
     }
    }

I am calling the web service from ASP using something like:

    provWSDL = "http://servername:12011/MessageProcessor.asmx?wsdl"
    Set service = CreateObject("MSSOAP.SoapClient30")
    service.ClientProperty("ServerHTTPRequest") = True
    Call service.MSSoapInit(provWSDL)
    
    xmlMessage = "<request><task>....various xml</task></request>"
    result = service.ProcessMessage(xmlMessage)


The problem I am encountering is that when the XML reaches the ProcessMessage method, the web service plumbing has added a default namespace along the way. i.e. if I set a breakpoint inside ProcessMessage(XmlDocument message) I see:

    <request xmlns="http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing">
      <task>....various xml</task> 
    </request>

When I capture packets on the wire I can see that the inbound XML to the web service is unmolested so it's the .NET WS stack that's adding this namespace. If I call the web service from a .NET client (Add web reference etc) then the default namespace is empty, as it should be.

It's been so long since I used the ASP/SOAP toolkit to call into .NET webservices, I can't remember all the clever tricks I used to pull to get around stuff like this.

Any ideas? One solution is to knock up a COM callable .NET proxy that takes the XML as a string param and calls the WS on my behalf, but it's an extra layer of complexity/work I hoped not to do.

Thanks for looking.

Now, obviously I could implement the [IXmlSerializable](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.serialization.ixmlserializable.aspx) interface and then chuck a reader/writer to it but I would like to avoid that since it then means I need to instantiate a reader/writer whenever I want to do it, and 99.99% of the time I am going to be working with a _string_ so I may just write my own.

However, to serialize to XML, I am simply decorating the class and its members with the _Xml???_ attributes ( _XmlRoot_ , _XmlElement_ etc.) and then passing it to the _XmlSerializer_ and a _StringWriter_ to get the string. Which is all good. I intend to put the method to return the string into a generic utility method so I dont need to worry about type etc.

The this that concerns me is this: If I do not decorate the class(es) with the required attributes an error is not thrown until run time..

Personally, I think it is A BAD THING.

My reasons are thrice:

1) It circumvents my well architectured MVP framework - with databinding, the view communicates bi-directionally with a model.  Ewww.

2) It promotes hooking up view controls to datafields at design time.  In my experience, this leads to vital code (binding column A to Field X) being obscure and hidden away in some designer file.  IMO this code should be explicit and in-your-face, so that it is easy to modify and see what is going on, without having to use a clunky designer interface.

3) Relating to Point 1) this direct binding makes it harder to isolate each component (view, model, controller/presenter) and unit-test.  

The PROS are that it is easy to set up, and you can take advantage of some nice features (validation etc) which come with the plumbing already done for you.  

But for me, databinding becomes much more of a hindrance when dealing with a large data-centric application.

Any thoughts?

There is one exception to this -- I'd like all requests  to the <code>/audio</code> path *not* to be redirected.

I've written a RewriteCond and RewriteRule to do this but it's not quite right and I can't figure out why.  The regular expression contains a negative lookahead for the string "/audio", but for some reason this isn't matching.  Here's the definition:

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(.*\.)?mydomain\.net(?!/audio) [NC]
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.newdomain.net [L,R=301]

If I change the RewriteCond to:

    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(.*\.)?mydomain\.net/(?!audio) [NC]

(i.e. put the forward slash outside of the negative lookahead part) then it works, but the downside of this is that requests to mydomain.net without a trailing slash will not be redirected.

Can anyone point out what I'm doing wrong?

<pre>Table: Property
Fields: ID, Address

Table: Quote
Fields: ID, PropertyID, BespokeQuoteFields...

Table: Job
Fields: ID, PropertyID, BespokeJobFields...</pre>

Then we have other tables that relate to the **Quote** and **Job** tables individually.

I now need to add a **Message** table where users can record telephone messages left by customers regarding Jobs and Quotes.

I could create two identical tables (**QuoteMessage** and **JobMessage**), but this violates the DRY principal and seems messy.

I could create one **Message** table:

<pre>Table: Message
Fields: ID, RelationID, RelationType, OtherFields...</pre>

But this stops me from using constraints to enforce my referential integrity.  I can also forsee it creating problems with the devlopment side using Linq to SQL later on.

Is there an elegant solution to this problem, or am I ultimately going to have to hack something together?

Say you have a really old project that every once in a while needs a document update in a database system or something like that. The database application is running on a virtualized desktop that is only started when needed.

I think we could save energy, hardware and space if we would virtualize some of those old boxes. Any setups in your company?##C##<virtualization><legacy><desktop>##C##@$R$@

    Status MyFunction()
    {
       if(...) // something bad
         return new Status(false, "Something went wrong")
       else
         return new Status(true, "OK");
    }
You get the idea.
All callers of MyFunction *should* check the returned Status:

    Status myStatus = MyFunction();
    if ( ! myStatus.IsOK() )
       // handle it, show a message,...
Lazy callers however can ignore the Status.

    MyFunction(); // call function and ignore returned Status

or 

    {
      Status myStatus = MyFunction(); 
    } // loose all references to myStatus, without calling IsOK() on it

Is it possible to make this impossible? e.g. an throw exception

**In general**: is it possible to write a C# class on which you *have* to call a certain function?


In the C++ version of the Status class, I can write a test on some private bool bIsChecked in the *destructor* and ring some bells when someone doesn't check this instance.

What is the equivalent option in C#?
I read somewhere that "You don't want a destructor in your C# class"

Is the Dispose method of the IDisposable interface an option?

In this case there are no unmanaged resources to free.
Additionally, it is not determined *when* the GC will dispose the object.
When it eventually gets disposed, is it still possible to know where and when you ignored that specific Status instance?
The "using" keyword does help, but again, it is not *required* for lazy callers.

Thanks in advance!

How should they approach introducing this new technology? Obviously with only one of the developers actually knowing Python, there will be no redundancy when that dev is away or leaves the company.

Calculating M is easy. Load C using classloader and use reflection to get the count of methods.

Calculating R is not direct. We need to count the number of method calls from the class. First level only. 

For calculating R i must use regex. Usually format would be ( calls with out using. are not counted)

The second is to allow file attachments (PDFs, etc) in a messaging system.
My question is what the best use practice would be in these situations to remain DRY, clear, and consistent.

I would like to import the application to Maven and Subversion. After some research I found that two practical approaches exists for this.

One is using a tree structure just as the previous one. The drawback of this structure is that you need a ton of tweaking/hacks to get the multi-module reporting work well with Maven. Another downside is that in Subversion the standard trunk/tags/branches approach add even more complexity to the repository.

The other approach uses a flat structure, where there are only one parent project and all the modules, submodules and parts-of-the-submodules are a direct child of the parent project. This approach works well for reporting and is easier in Subversion, however I feel I lose a bit of the structure this way.

Which way would you choose in the long term and why?##C##<java><subversion><maven-2>##C##@$R$@

One of the nastier issues during my last years was keeping track of database schema changes and deploying these changes to productive systems. I haven't dared asking for being able to undo them too, but of course for testing and debugging that would be a great feature. From other questions here (such as [this one][1] or [this one][2]), I can see that I'm not alone and that this is not a trivial problem. Also, I found many inspirations in the answers there.

Now, as Django seems to be very powerful, does it have any tools to help with the above? Maybe it's even in their docs and I missed it? The "syncdb" command that creates tables from your models seems promising but is it that powerful?

For those that don't know (probably everyone), Project Darkstar is a framework for massively multiplayer online games that attempts to take care of all of the "hard stuff."  The basic idea is that you write your game server logic in such a way that all operations are broken up into tiny tasks.  You pass these tasks to the Project Darkstar framework which handles distributing them to a specific node in the cluster, any concurrency issues, and finally persisting the data.

Apparently doing this kind of thing is a much different problem for video games than it is for enterprise applications.  Jim Waldo, who gave the lecture, claims that MMO games have a DB read/write ration of 50/50, whereas enterprise apps are more like 90% read, 10% write.  He also claims that most existing MMOs keep everything in memory exlcusively, and only dump to a DB every 6 hours of so.  This means if a server goes down, you would lose all of the work since the last DB dump.

Now, the project itself sounds really cool, but I don't think the industry will accept it.  First, you have to write your server code in Java.  The client code can be written in anything (Jim claims ActionScript 3 is the most popular, follow by C++), but the server stuff has to be Java.  Sounds good to me, but I really get the impression that everyone in the games industry hates Java.

Second, unlike other industries where developers prefer to use existing frameworks and libraries, the guys in the games industry seem to like to write everything themselves.  Not only that, they like to rewrite everything for every new game they produce.  Things are starting to change where developers are using Havok for physics, Unreal Engine 3 as their platform, etc., but for the most part it looks like everything is still proprietary.

So, are the guys at Project Darkstar just wasting their time?  Can a general framework like this really work for complex games with the performance that is required?  Even if it does work, are game companies willing to use it?

I attached the profiler, set up a trace profile using [this excellent article on troubleshooting deadlocks](http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/how-to-track-down-deadlocks-using-sql-server-2005-profiler/), and captured a bunch of examples. The weird thing is that **the deadlocking write is *always* the same**:

    UPDATE [dbo].[Posts]
    SET [AnswerCount] = @p1, [LastActivityDate] = @p2, [LastActivityUserId] = @p3
    WHERE [Id] = @p0

The other deadlocking statement varies, but it's usually some kind of trivial, simple **read** of the posts table. This one always gets killed in the deadlock. To be perfectly clear, we are not seeing write / write deadlocks, but read / write.

We have a mixture of LINQ and parameterized SQL queries at the moment. We have added `with (nolock)` to all the SQL queries. This may have helped some. We also had a single (very) poorly-written badge query that I fixed yesterday, which was taking upwards of 20 seconds to run every time, and was running every minute on top of that. I was hoping this was the source of some of the locking problems!

Unfortunately, I got another deadlock error about 2 hours ago. Same exact symptoms, same exact culprit write.

The truly strange thing is that the locking write SQL statement you see above is part of a very specific code path. It's *only* executed when a new answer is added to a question -- it updates the parent question with the new answer count and last date/user. This is, obviously, not that common relative to the massive number of reads we are doing! As far as I can tell, we're not doing huge numbers of writes anywhere in the app.

I realize that NOLOCK is sort of a giant hammer, but most of the queries we run here don't need to be that accurate. Will you care if your user profile is a few seconds out of date?

Using NOLOCK with Linq is a bit more difficult as [Scott Hanselman discusses here](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GettingLINQToSQLAndLINQToEntitiesToUseNOLOCK.aspx).

We are flirting with the idea of using

    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED

on the base database context so that all our LINQ queries have this set. Without that, we'd have to wrap every LINQ call we make (well, the simple reading ones, which is the vast majority of them) in a 3-4 line transaction code block, which is ugly.

I guess I'm a little frustrated that trivial reads in SQL 2005 can deadlock on writes. I could see write/write deadlocks being a huge issue, but *reads?* We're not running a banking site here, we don't need perfect accuracy every time.

The logic is written as a [pipelined table function][1], following the pattern from the linked article. The table function uses a `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` declaration to permit the temporary table manipulation, and also accepts a cursor input parameter to restrict the denormalization to certain ID values.

I then created a view to query the table function, passing in all possible ID values as a cursor (other uses of the function will be more restrictive).

The problem I have is that I have a collection, which is of a abstract base class type, which is populated by the concrete derived types.

Fine.
