	4/25/16:
		because we're working on different copies of the database, we have some drift between the two
		Luke should have completed both joins shortly, so we'll work off that database output.

		I need to modify the second join (users with post-postHistory) to run it on my subset
		I also need to run the queries to compute the features
		-> Then I'll be able to write corpus.py and feature_join.py

		Questions for Luke:
			were both indices created before the double join? ( postHistory.postID and post.userId)
			will the computing features run efficiently on the entire dataset?
